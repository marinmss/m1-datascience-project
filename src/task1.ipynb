Pantazi, and Ghaki; 15 March 1831 – 17 July 1882) was a Wallachian, later Romanian politician and lawyer, also known as a dramatist, poet, short story writer, and literary critic. A prominent representative of the liberal current, he was the younger brother and lifelong collaborator of Ion Ghica, who served as Prime Minister of the Romanian Kingdom in 1866-1867 and again in 1870-1871. Pantazi Ghica began his political career as a participant in the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, a collaborator of the Romantic historian and activist Nicolae Bălcescu, and a member of the radical grouping headed by C. A. Rosetti. Although twice involved in the administration of Buzău County, Ghica lived much of his life in exile or in Bucharest, and was also a soldier for the Ottoman Empire during the Crimean War. After 1875, he was a prominent member of the National Liberal Party.\\r\\nGenerally seen as a mediocre writer, he was foremost noted for his associations with the literary figures Nicolae Filimon, Vasile Alecsandri, Dimitrie Bolintineanu, Alexandru Odobescu and Alexandru Macedonski, as well as for his extended polemic with the conservative literary society Junimea. Ghica\\'s work and political convictions were criticized and often ridiculed by Junimist intellectuals such as Titu Maiorescu, Mihai Eminescu, and Ion Luca Caragiale. He is most likely one of the unnamed liberal politicians who are negatively portrayed in Eminescu\\'s poem Scrisoarea a III-a.\\r\\nPantazi Ghica suffered from kyphosis. Notably, this physical defect is mentioned for satirical effect in Eminescu\\'s poem and in Caragiale\\'s autobiographical work, Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nEarly life and revolutionary activities\\r\\nPantazi was born into the Ghica family, a prestigious group of Phanariote hospodars and boyars in the Danubian Principalities, whose origins were Greek and Albanian. He was the twelfth of fifteen children born to Ban Dimitrie Ghica and his wife Maria Câmpineanu (a boyaress of the Câmpineanu family). Ion, Pantazi, Temistocle and Maria Ghica were the only four children to survive into adulthood.\\r\\nLike his siblings, Pantazi Ghica studied at the Saint Sava College in Wallachia\\'s capital. It was around that time that he befriended the poet Bolintineanu, who was twelve years his senior and by then already a friend of Ion Ghica. His mother later took him to France, where he is known to have been enlisted in a boarding house. Upon his return to Wallachia in 1847, together with his brother, Ghica was involved in the agitation leading up to the 1848 uprising, and became Bălcescu\\'s secretary. Before the revolution toppled Prince Gheorghe Bibescu and created a new administration, Bălcescu sent Pantazi Ghica as an agitator, in service to the revolutionary organization Frăţia. Ghica was assigned the task of spreading propaganda in the counties of Buzău and Prahova. A common Russian-Ottoman intervention quelled the rebellion in autumn of the same year, to reestablish the Regulamentul Organic government. Both Ghica brothers, like most other revolutionaries, were arrested and exiled from Wallachia.\\r\\n\\r\\nExile\\r\\nThe younger Ghica again settled in Paris, were his mother Maria was still residing. Following her death, he moved to Istanbul, joining his brother Ion (who was soon after offered protection by Sultan Abdülmecid I). Again in Paris by 1849, he became close friends with a group of Wallachian revolutionaries in exile, including D. Berindey, the physician Iatropolu, Alexandru Zissu and George Creţeanu; the five exiles signed a blood brotherhood pact.\\r\\nGhica attended high society meetings, and befriended a tenor at the Opéra National de Paris. He later claimed to have maintained close contacts with famous Parisian literary figures such as Alexandre Dumas and Alfred de Musset, and to have introduced them to Romanian culture—this was to be disputed by his Romanian adversaries, who noted that the account provided inaccurate details. Reportedly, he also associated with literary critic Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr, composers Daniel Auber and Fromental Halévy, and playwright Eugène Scribe. He probably studied for a while at the University of Paris\\' Law Faculty, but it is unclear whether he ever completed his education. His detractors later claimed that Pantazi Ghica had spent more time in the debtors\\' prison than among students, while Ion Ghica is known to have objected to his brother\\'s lifestyle and to have asked Bălcescu to supervise him.\\r\\nAround 1850, he fell in love with Camila de Fernex, who was related to the family of his French host, Aimé Guyet de Fernex. They were married in March 1852, when the Catholic Camila obtained a matrimonial dispensation from Marie-Dominique-Auguste Sibour, the Archbishop of Paris. Records of the events show that the matter of his marriage was only settled at the end of a long debate: the Romanian Orthodox Ghica had initially consented to have his children baptized Catholic, and then retracted his statement, leaving Archbishop Sibour to consent after obtaining a less compelling verbal agreement from him. The wedding ceremony took place at a Greek Orthodox church in Marseille.\\r\\nThe brothers Ghica returned to Bucharest separately during the late 1850s. Their arrival coincided with the outbreak of the Crimean War: Pantazi Ghica joined the Ottoman Army, serving as a Yüzbaşı in the Cossack Corps (part of the Imperial Guard). Decorated and promoted, he was again present in Bucharest as Russia was defeated and the Treaty of Paris allowed Wallachia to decide a new administration. Ion Ghica, who was promoted Bey of Samos Island in 1854, unsuccessfully applied for the office of Wallachian Prince during 1858, and later rose to ministerial offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nProsecutor, lawyer and journalist\\r\\nIn 1856-1858, he was a prosecutor in Dâmbovița County, before starting a private practice as a lawyer on Bucharest\\'s Podul Mogoșoaiei. Pantazi Ghica subsequently became one of the main liberal activists, and rallied with its most radical wing, that headed by Rosetti. This came at a time when Wallachia\\'s united with Moldavia under the rule of Alexandru Ioan Cuza (proclaimed in 1859, and effected in 1862). Following Cuza\\'s election in both countries, Ghica joined the civil service: he first replaced his friend George Crețeanu as inspector in the Ministry of Justice (April–September 1859) and department head in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (before 1860). He returned to his practice, and, in 1861, was a legal representative for people arrested during the anti-unionist riots in Craiova. In 1862, he was appointed attorney for the Ministry of Education.\\r\\nIn 1859, Pantazi Ghica joined Dimitrie Bolintineanu in editing the journal Dâmbovița, but, just a year later, his articles were the subject of a scandal, and he was arrested for allegedly breaking the ethics of journalism. He shared a cell with his colleague, N. T. Orășanu, a noted adversary of Carol\\'s rule. He was also an associate of the writer Alexandru Odobescu, and, after 1861, collaborated on his monthly literary magazine Revista Română. It was here that he published a critical review of Ciocoii vechi și noi, a novel by his friend Nicolae Filimon, which upset the latter (as a consequence, relations between the two soured). For a while during those years, Ghica edited two satirical magazine, Păcală (named in honor of the eponymous folk hero) and Scrânciobul.\\r\\nIn 1863, he went on a trip to Moldavia, where he notably visited his relative Cleopatra Ghica (married into the Russian Trubetskoy family). He was again involved in a trial for calumny, but he was able to prove that the incriminated article was not his. Ghica also took interest in the activities of Iacob Negruzzi, a Moldavian-born writer who arrived in Bucharest around 1865—it was Ghica who introduced Negruzzi to the Rosetti circle. By the 1870s, he was also contributing articles to Rosetti\\'s journal Românul. During the same period, he began publishing his literary pieces in Revista Contimporană.\\r\\nIn 1866, Domnitor Cuza was replaced with Carol of Hohenzollern. Apparently, Pantazi Ghica had played a secondary part in the conspiracy that toppled Cuza, as a local commander of the Citizens\\' Guard. Ghica was subsequently assigned the office of Buzău County prefect by the first of his brother\\'s cabinets. The appointment was welcomed by Vasile Alecsandri, who was keeping a detailed correspondence with both brothers. However, his time in office was cut short, allegedly because he came to be disliked by Carol. He returned to the capital, where he purchased a villa on Cometei Street (the present-day Căderea Bastiliei Street), nearby Piața Romană. For a second time in eight years, he was exposed to public scrutiny for having failed to honor his debts: in 1868, his possessions in Buzău were sequestrated. Late in the year, he was Alecsandri\\'s representative during a legal conflict with the peasants residing on his domain (after winning the trial, Alecsandri reciprocated by introducing Ghica to his friend, Minister of the Interior Mihail Kogălniceanu).\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal years\\r\\nHis new Bucharest residence became a meeting spot for literary figures. Ghica notably associated with the much younger Symbolist poet Alexandru Macedonski, who was also his neighbor. In 1875, Pantazi Ghica was witness to a scandal involving the Romanian Army and Ion Emanuel Florescu, the Minister of War. That year, the officer Ioan Crainic, who considered himself insulted by Florescu, handed in his resignation from the military and challenged the Minister to a duel (asking Ghica to serve as both his courier and witness); the problems were eventually avoided after Florescu ordered his subordinates to arrest Crainic. At the time, Macedonski engaged in liberal politics, and, in 1876, co-founded the short-lived newspaper Stindardul, alongside Ghica, Bonifaciu Florescu, and George Fălcoianu. The publication was inspired by the renowned journalist Nicolae Moret Blaremberg. Later, Ghica also published essays in Macedonski\\'s newly founded and more prestigious magazine, Literatorul.\\r\\nHe was for long a member of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, representing the \"Red\" liberal tendency and, late in life, the National Liberals. In June 1876, shortly after the first concentrated National Liberal cabinet came to power, he and Nicolae Fleva spearheaded the effort to prosecute the former \"White\" Conservative ministers. In opening the case, Ghica stated: \"It wasn\\'t just us who condemned those ministers, but public opinion in general, the entire country, cast a blame on them, and we are the expression of that blame\". The effort pitted Pantazi Ghica against his main literary rival, outgoing Education Minister Titu Maiorescu, who was called in for questioning. The attempt to stage a trial was ultimately defeated by moderates in Ghica\\'s own party, who ignored his vocal protests.\\r\\nIn June 1881, promoting the designs of one Traian Theodorescu, Pantazi Ghica unsuccessfully presented Parliament with a proposal to have a submarine built for the Romanian Navy. During the same year, he was a cabinet-appointed inspector of historical monuments in Moldavia. In spring of 1882, shortly before his death, Ghica, like many of his fellow National Liberals, spoke out against I. Filibiliu, a teacher at the Matei Basarab High School who had administered a mild form of corporal punishment to one of his pupils.\\r\\nPantazi Ghica died at his house on Cometei Street, and was buried at his family\\'s estate in Ghergani. Camila Ghica survived him by 21 years: reportedly afflicted by dementia in old age, she died in 1908, at the age of 80.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn culture\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nGhica published the first of his many Romantic novellas by the 1860s, when he collaborated on Odobescu\\'s magazine. Literary critic Tudor Vianu noted that some of his works had a strong connection with Bohemianism, while others are thought to be influenced by the Romantic author Dimitrie Bolintineanu. With time, however, Ghica moved away from Romanticism, and developed his own brand of Realism, which did not exclude imagination and speculation, and which hailed Alecsandri as a prime example of writing. He was also opposed to Macedonski\\'s notion of \"sublime absurdity\", arguing that the definitive criterion for creating poetic imagery was significance, and proposing elements of didacticism to feature in every work. In one instance, he argued that beauty \"must absolutely be united with the good\".\\r\\nGhica\\'s work of hidden memoirs, the novella Un boem român (\"A Romanian Bohemian\"), was a tale of adventure and unrequited love: its main character, Paul, whose adventures mirror many in Ghica\\'s life, elopes with a married woman, only to find that she is not faithful to him either. The plot is probably the first one in Romanian literature to discuss the topic of free love. In 1850, Ghica authored a piece in honor of the deceased poet Vasile Cârlova, titled O lacrimă a poetului Cârlova (\"One of Poet Cârlova\\'s Tears\"). It depicted Cârlova drinking from a skull-shaped cup with the inscription Lina, adu-ţi aminte! (\"Lina, remember!\", allegedly in honor of a nun he had loved).\\r\\nIn addition, Pantazi Ghica wrote a lengthy satire the high society in his day (Schiţe din societatea română, \"Sketches of the Romanian Society\"), and, as a result of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the play Răniţii români (\"The Wounded Romanians\"). Ghica was outraged to find that the National Theater did not accept his play, and, as a consequence, issued a formal protest. He contributed several romantic comedies, including, among others, Iadeş (\"Wishbone\") and Sterian Păţitul (roughly, \"Sterian Who Has Learned\"). He is also the most likely author of a piece sometimes attributed to his brother, in which the author explores the literary legacy of Don Juan.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeţia de cuvinte\\r\\nBy the close of the 1860s, Pantazi Ghica was among the main targets of early criticism from Junimea—a literary society which expressed a conservative vision and was opposed to the cultural and political tenets of liberalism. Ghica\\'s works were among those discussed by Junimea\\'s Titu Maiorescu in his famous essay of 1873, Beţia de cuvinte. The title, meaning literally \"inebriation with words\", attacked Romantic liberals over their experiments with Romanian language, their Romantic nationalist aesthetic guidelines, and their emphatic prose. The influential Maiorescu saw these as a main source for the widespread cultural and social problems facing Romania during its process of Westernization.\\r\\nThus, Revista Contimporană contributors such as Ghica, V. A. Urechia, August Treboniu Laurian, and Gheorghe Sion are listed by Maiorescu as negative examples in Romanian literature, for their use of coined neologisms, as well as for their tautologies and contradictions. Maiorescu sarcastically recorded that Ghica was introducing new words to the Romanian lexis, through the means of Francization. Among other samples, the author used as illustrations several fragments from Pantazi Ghica\\'s novella Marele vistier Cândescu (\"The Great Treasurer Cândescu\"). He noted the implicit tautology in Ghica\\'s term silenţiu lugubru (\"lugubrious silence\"), pointing out that the first word covered the meaning of \"silent\" (thus leaving the notion to be read \"silent silence\"). A more complex one, listing several synonyms on end, read:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"[...] all left in silence but their faces showed the same pain, the same exasperation, the same desperation.\"\\r\\nPantazi Ghica, Urechia, Dimitrie August Laurian and Petru Grădişteanu decided to issue a common reply to Maiorescu\\'s accusations, using Românul as their venue. The Junimist intellectual believed that their answer was an ignoratio elenchi, and dismissed their defense as \"beside the point\" (nu e la chestie). On the occasion, he also presented Ghica with more of his own mistakes.\\r\\nAlthough not a Junimist, Odobescu himself agreed with such views, and pointed out further inexactitudes in the works of Pantazi Ghica—these comments are featured in a chapter of his major book, the Pseudo-cynegetikos, in its revised edition of 1887. Odobescu recorded the polemic between Ghica and the contributors to Junimea\\'s magazine Convorbiri Literare—the former stood accused of having embellished his own biography by claiming to have won the interest of French writers during his stay in Paris. Odobescu hinted that he agreed with this assessment, stressing that Alexandre Dumas and Alfred de Musset had since died, and thus could not confirm that Pantazi Ghica had befriended them. He also noted, like the Junimists, that the chronological order indicated by Ghica was spurious. The latter argument referred to Ghica\\'s statement that, in 1852, Dumas and de Musset had listened to his rendition of Vasile Alecsandri\\'s poem Înşiră-te Mărgărite, which had in fact been completed in 1856, and first made available for the public four years later.\\r\\nGhica was unnerved by Maiorescu\\'s reaction to his work, and verbally attacked the younger literary critic in several contexts spanning his career. This was the case in 1878, when both of them stood in the Chamber for opposite camps, and when Ghica heckled Maiorescu, who was giving a speech. On one occasion, Pantazi Ghica depicted Maiorescu as \"a sort of a literary trickster\", and himself claimed that his adversary was \"at odds with grammar\". Elsewhere, he claimed that Maiorescu\\'s style \"entirely lacks the conditions of serious criticism\". With time, the conflict between Ghica and Convorbiri Literare degenerated into open hostility. Thus, in an unsigned piece of 1875, the magazine claimed to translate Victor Hugo\\'s Chansons des rues et des bois: instead of the hunchback Mayeux, whom Hugo had placed at the end of a cortege grouping all animals, the Convorbiri Literare version had introduced \"Pantazi\" and adapted the rhyme accordingly.\\r\\nMaiorescu\\'s verdicts on Pantazi Ghica were shared by more modern Romanian critics. Tudor Vianu called Ghica \"prolific, but not gifted\". Elsewhere, he backed Ghica\\'s inclusion among the \"victims of Inebriation with words [italics in the original]\", as well as Maiorescu\\'s criticism of his Francized speech. Vianu\\'s generation colleague George Călinescu defined Pantazi Ghica as \"untalented\" (although he acknowledged his \"vast literary culture\"), while Ştefan Cazimir likened his writings for the stage to what he believed was Ion Luca Caragiale\\'s worst play, the melodrama O soacră. Călinescu referred to Marele vistier Cândescu as featuring \"annoying neologisms\" and \"the lack of any intuition, no matter how modest, for historical color.\" Two exceptions among commentators were Gheorghe Adamescu, who valued several of Ghica\\'s works (including his 1850 piece about Vasile Cârlova), and Ştefan Sihleanu, who credited Ghica with having single-handedly introduced Alessandro Manzoni\\'s type of historical novels to local literature, in their adapted novella form.\\r\\n\\r\\nGhica\\'s politics and the Junimists\\r\\nThe conservative groupings were especially critical of Pantazi Ghica\\'s politics. Iacob Negruzzi, who eventually rallied with the Junimists, resented Rosetti\\'s radical circle, and left an unflattering memoir of its meetings. Several other writers who associated with Junimea attacked the two brothers Ghica for their alleged corruption and demagogy. In Mihai Eminescu\\'s lengthy poem Scrisoarea a III-a, an entire section elaborates a virulent anti-liberal discourse. Of it, a group of lyrics are believed to refer to Pantazi Ghica (identified by his appearance and his kyphosis) or, alternatively, to a composite portrayal of the two brothers. They read:\\r\\n\\r\\nEminescu followed Ghica\\'s political career with interest. In one of his articles for the Conservative journal Timpul, published in early 1882, he examined the Filibiliu affair, he took the teacher\\'s side, arguing that both Ghica and Filibiliu\\'s other National Liberal detractor, Petru Grădişteanu, were exaggerating. He commented that the scandal was largely owed to the victim\\'s father having made use of his political connections with the Ion Brătianu cabinet, and protested when the teacher assigned a provincial post as a punitive measure. This was one of several polemics between Eminescu and various associates of Rosetti: literary historian Perpessicius argued that they were partly responsible for the \"super-tensed\" relations between Românul and Timpul. George Călinescu identified other, less-known, poems by Eminescu, which also allude to Ghica\\'s style, politics and personal life.\\r\\nThe dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, who wrote many of his works under the influence of Junimist principles, developed his own thesis on the political shortcomings of the liberal trend. As part of it, he argued that there was an essential difference between, on one hand, the major liberal figures of the 1848 revolution (Nicolae Bălcescu, Ion Câmpineanu and Ion Heliade Rădulescu) and, on the other, members of the National Liberal Party such as Pantazi Ghica, Nicolae Misail and Mihail Pătârlăgeanu. In his view, the latter group usurped the revolutionary legacy, while the former could have found itself best represented by the emerging Conservative Party.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnecdotes\\r\\nA socialite, Ghica was famed for his hectic lifestyle and his eclectic culture, which earned him the moniker Fantazaki (a pun on his two names, it originated in fantezie, the Romanian word for \"fantasy\") and the colloquial title of \"king of the Romanian Bohemia\". Among his recorded eccentricities were the contrast in his attitudes toward dogs and cats (a lover of the former, he despised the latter), and his refusal to travel anywhere except by coach. A rumor which probably made it into Eminescu\\'s poetry had it that Pantazi Ghica, the alleged lover of famed and usually foreign actresses, sold tickets to their shows in front of coffee houses. Nonetheless, others knew him as a gentleman, praising him for his kindness and sociability.\\r\\nAt some stage in their lives, Pantazi Ghica and his friend C. A. Rosetti briefly associated with a circle of actors meeting in the house of theater manager Iorgu Caragiale (Ion Luca\\'s uncle). Ion Luca Caragiale\\'s 1907 work, Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur, featured an anecdote about Pantazi Ghica and Iorgu Caragiale, recounting how the former had fallen in love with an unnamed actress. According to the story, Ghica, who had asked the group of actors to facilitate an amorous meeting with the object of his affection, was the target of a prank: Iorgu Caragiale reportedly arranged for his colleague, a certain Matache Piţirigă, to dress up in female clothes and meet Ghica in an unlit room. The story went that the Pantazi Ghica caressed Piţirigă, causing the latter to become indignant and thus reveal his true identity. According to Ion Luca Caragiale, a shocked Pantazi Ghica ran out of the room and into the Fialcowsky coffee house. The amused reaction of the public surprised him, and he subsequently found that, in the dark, Piţirigă had smeared his face with soot. In its initial unpublished version, Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur simply described Iorgu Caragiale\\'s victim as \"a hunchback\". Caragiale later added to his own text:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"...When, a couple of years back, I was adding the lines above to my notebook, the cheated young man was still alive; today he is dead—may God forgive all the lyrics and all the prose with which he has enriched our young literature, all the speeches he has held in succession in front of the two Chambers and during public meetings!—and since «one should only speak well of the dead», here is name pure and simple: Pantazi Ghica.\"\\r\\nAnother anecdote of the time had it that Pantazi Ghica was deeply resented by Domnitor Carol. According to the story, this was sparked by one of Carol\\'s hunting trips in the vicinity of Buzău. Ghica, who was charged with organizing the event, allegedly thought he could gain more favor with the monarch by using a bear which, unbeknown to Carol, had been previously tamed by Romani trainers (see Ursari). Carol found out that this was the case, and, feeling insulted, ordered Pantazi Ghica to be relieved from his office of prefect. The short-lived magazine Satyrul once accused Ghica of having plagiarized for his Iadeş, and of having only added a dog as a character to separate his text from the source. As a result, a series of satirical lithographs, with Pantazi Ghica as their subject, showed a hunchback man in the company of a hunchback dog. Jokes about his medical condition even made it into the Chamber: a fellow deputy once made a public reference to Pantazi Ghica\\'s arched spine, to which Ghica replied that it seemed arched because he only presented such colleagues with his back.\\r\\nIn 2010, researcher Radu Cernătescu proposed that Pantazi Ghica is the inspiration behind Gore Pirgu, the prototype social climber depicted in Craii de Curtea-Veche novel. The work, a Romanian classic, was written in the 1920s by Caragiale\\'s estranged son Mateiu, and, Cernătescu notes, shows Ghica in company with decadent aristocrats from the Cantacuzino and Soutzos clans.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n(in Romanian) Gheorghe Adamescu, Istoria literaturii române Archived 2007-07-21 at the Wayback Machine, at Biblioteca Românească Archived 2008-09-11 at the Wayback Machine; retrieved August 19, 2007:\\r\\nII.2. \"Epoca lui Alecsandri (1848-1870)\". a) \"1848-1859\"\\r\\nII.2. \"Epoca lui Alecsandri (1848-1870)\". b) \"1860-1870\"\\r\\nIII.2. \"Epoca lui Eminescu (1880-1900)\". a) \"1880-1890\" Archived 2007-07-21 at the Wayback Machine\\r\\nIon Bulei, \"Liberalii şi conservatorii în proces (I)\", in Magazin Istoric, January 1973, p. 25–30\\r\\nGeorge Călinescu, Istoria literaturii române de la origini până în prezent, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1986\\r\\nŞtefan Cazimir, Caragiale: universul comic, Editura pentru Literatură, Bucharest, 1967.

OCLC 7431692', 'Jes�s Rafael Soto (June 5, 1923 � January 17, 2005) was a Venezuelan op and kinetic artist, a sculptor and a painter.\\r\\nHis works can be found in the collections of the main museums of the world, including Tate (London), Museum Ludwig (Germany), Centre Georges Pompidou (Paris), Galleria Nazionale d\\'Arte Moderna (Roma) and MoMA (New York). One of the main museums of art in Venezuela, in his home town, has his name in tribute to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nJes�s Rafael Soto was born in Ciudad Bol�var in Venezuela.  The eldest of four children born to Emma Soto and Luis Garcia Parra, a violin player.  From a very young age, Soto wanted to help support his family anyway he could, but art was the most interesting to him. He picked up the guitar and also began recreating famous pieces of art that he found in various books, magazines and almanacs.\\r\\nAt 16, Soto started his serious artistic career when he began to create and paint posters for the cinemas in Ciudad Bolivar. \"At that age - says the artist -, the only artists that I knew were the lettering painters. My family was very happy. I could earn some money, make lettering till the end of my days. Nobody looked further than that...\"\\r\\nIn 1938, Soto participates in a student group affiliated to surrealism ideas and publish in the local journal some poems that scandalize the society. In the group, Soto learns about automatic writing and charcoal drawing.  \"I drew heads, portraits, I had a great technique. Finally, there were people that made a petition, the bishop asked to see it and he signed it. I got a scholarship�\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\nIn 1942 he received a scholarship to study artistic training at the Escuela de Artes Pl�sticas y Artes Aplicadas (Plastic and Applied Arts School) in Caracas, finishing his studies in 1947. Once there, he took classes in \"pure art\" and the \"training course for instructors in art education history.\" The director of the school, Antonio Edmundo Monsanto, was instrumental to Soto�s career as well as other very important Venezuelan artist (Omar Carre�o, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Narsico Deboug, Dora Hersen, Mateo Manaure, Luis Guevara, Pascual Navarro, Mercedes Pardo and Alejandro Otero) since he often brought inspirations from foreign countries to his students, including the latest from the avant-garde: cubism.\\r\\n\"When I got in the Fine Arts School - says Soto -, the first thing I saw was the reproduction of a dead nature of Braque\". This image caused such impact on him because \"...the color started to separate off the form\" and because of the multiplicity of the viewing points that he wanted to represent. For Soto, this was the starting point.\\r\\n\\r\\nInfluences\\r\\nAfter Soto had graduated from Escuela de Artes Plasticas y Artes Aplicadas, receiving a teaching degree, he was then hired to be the director of the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Maracaibo from 1947 to 1950. When he was teaching there, he received a government grant to travel to France, and settled in Paris.\\r\\nIn France, Soto discovered Paul Klee and Piet Mondrian�s work, and the latter suggested the idea of �dynamizing the neoplasticism�. This, joined with Soto\\'s will to create a new sort of movement that would add to three dimensional art concluded in associations with Yaacov Agam, Jean Tinguely, Victor Vasarely, and other artists connected with the Salon des R�alit�s Nouvelles and the Galerie Denise Ren�.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nIn the beginning, Soto painted post-impressionist works, latter getting interested in Cubism. After getting in touch with Malevich, Mondrian and the constructivists, Soto started to experiment with optical phenomena and op art and then he began to make art that was more than just pictures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first serial works\\r\\nIn the 1950s, Soto experimented with serial art: the repetition of formal elements in the plan, the depersonalization of the work and the revelation of the relativity of the vision. He achieved the reproduction of vibratory phenomena and, above all, the rupture of notions like composition and equilibrium. Making the work of art a fragment of an infinite reality, that could be repeated without varying its essential structure. Without a beginning, an end, up, down, right, left. Helped by notions from the mathematics and music fields, Soto makes his serial art.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncorporation of time and real movement\\r\\nThe next step on Soto\\'s works was incorporating time and real movement through the treatment of the space. The work should be an autonomous object, where \"real\" situations were put into play, and not a plan where a determinate vision was projected. At the same time that the spectator was moving in front of the work of art, to obtain from it its optical vibrational effects, time and real movement were being incorporated. In his Dos cuadrados en el espacio (1953), Soto began a series retaking the approaches of Malevich, specially about adopting the square as the \"only valid form\".\\r\\nIn his Desplazamiento de un cuadro transparente (1953�54) he created a spatial effect on a plane surface that latter was developed in a tridimensional way, superimposing two or more Plexiglas sheets, transparent but painted with straight or curved drawings that changed the way they were seen as the spectator moved, inviting the participation of the public. This work was the response to a discovery: the ambiguity of spatial perception\\r\\nIn 1955 Soto participated in the exhibition Le Mouvement, in the Denise Ren� gallery, in Paris. Other artists being shown were Yaacov Agam, Marcel Duchamp and Victor Vasarely. The exhibition prompted the publication of the �Yellow Manifest� about kinetic art and the visual researches involving spectators and stimulus. The kinetic art movement gained force in Europe and Latin-America after this exhibition.\\r\\n\\r\\nDematerialization of form\\r\\nAs results of the optical vibratory states that Soto achieves from the superposition of plans, a new situation appears: the outbreak of the solid body, its dematerialization in our retina, phenomena that is produced for the first time in Permutaci�n (1956). In Estructuras cin�ticas de elementos geom�tricos (1955-57) and Armon�a transformable (1956) is added a new element that was relegated in his research: color. It is about the superposition of different plexiglass planes, where color frames are inscribed, introducing new vibratory elements. The real division of the plane that had previously undergone an unfolding is produced here. Its structure already suggests a true spatial dimension, as a consequence of the equivalence of its obverse and its reverse. The situation becomes more complex, due to the multiplication of different lines, colors and directions. Plexiglass, medium that had provided the possibility of conforming aleatory states, begins to be an impediment and the search for a new way of materializing vibration starts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe conformation of a new visual order\\r\\nTo the preoccupation of searching for a new way of materializing the vibratory states is added the concern to approach human scale, integrating Soto\\'s works to architecture. This is how in Estructura Cin�tica (1957) the frames that had been drawn on plexiglass become real elements: metal rods welded between them. Soto\\'s works become real special objects that visitors are able to penetrate.\\r\\nIn the 1950s and beginning of the 1960s, starting from his basic concept of matter and space as different manifestations of energy, Soto had already structured the conceptual platform of his plastic language. Works like Escritura and Muro de Bruselas, both from 1958, already contain all the elements that will be developed later.\\r\\n\"My work of art - as Soto says -, is totally abstract. It was born from a reflection about painting and the propositions of our biggest (artists). I don\\'t copy nature, I isolate fundamental properties of the reality. For me, works are, before all, signs, no matter. It would be wrong to see in the work that is in front of you the object of my art, it isn\\'t there if not as a witness, sign of another thing...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSpace plenitude\\r\\nAll of Soto\\'s work, from start to end, answers to the same necessity of materialize his concept of the world as an impossible reality to measure in a human scale; vision where are vital the energy and space as essential situations inside nature. To reveal this situations in all of its complex dimension was the impulse that has fed his plastic research.\\r\\n\"When you enter a penetrable, you have the sensation of being in a light swirl, a total plenitude of vibrations. The Penetrable is a kind of concretization of this plenitude in which I make people move and make them feel the body of space. Is a way of materializing what exist, is an immaterial state, one state that for me isn\\'t irreal, but a reality. Reality exists all over the place and fill all the universe. Emptiness doesn\\'t exist, anywhere. This is my basic line of thought.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nContributions\\r\\n\\'Soto would set the bases for an art that transcended the conventional parameters of painting and sculpture.\\'  By inviting the spectator to participate in the work, instead of merely looking from a distance, Soto more deeply engages the audience, and makes the experience more intriguing and stimulating. Soto had a partner in this movement. On the other hand, his counterpart Carlos Cruz-Diez focused more on the way colours are perceived by the eye. One of his series called Fisicromias (Physiochromies) shows how coloured light is perceived and displaced through one\\'s eyes. Another artist that participated in this style was Alejandro Otero. His series Colortions (Rhythmicolors) combine the same concepts of the perception of colour in the eye and participators\\' movement with the work, but gave greater attention to how the colours are controlled with vertical lines.\\r\\nJes�s Rafael Soto died in 2005 in Paris, and is buried in the Cimeti�re du Montparnasse.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact\\r\\nLike many other Venezuelan artists from this time, Jesus Rafael Soto and Carlos Cruz-Diez considered their works a response to what they felt the problems were in art of their time. They wanted to express a more universal process of art. Because of this, their works are contributions that continue to enrich the art world. Their willingness to contribute and put themselves in a more universal approach to art, was a direct rebuttal to the traditional views of art in Latin America. With Venezuela, this was a way for them to add what they felt was missing in the art of Latin America.\\r\\nPainting, in history was an act of responding to the situation at hand in the mind of Soto and Cruz-Diez. \"Everything else was academic, anachronistic, or as Alejandro Otero said, \"the work of a man hiding behind time.\"\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCollections\\r\\nIn 1973, the Jes�s Soto Museum of Modern Art opened in Ciudad Bol�var, Venezuela with a collection of his work. Venezuelan architect Carlos Ra�l Villanueva designed the building for the museum and Italian op artist Getulio Alviani was called to run it. Something that is different about this gallery is that a large number of the exhibits are wired to the electricity supply so that they can move.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnvironmental integrations\\r\\n1957: \"Structure cin�tique\", Ciudad Universitaria, Caracas, Venezuela\\r\\n1958: \"Wall of Brussels\", I.V.I.C., Caracas, Venezuela (made for Universal Exhibition of Brussels, 1958). \"Tour de Bruxelles\", I.V.I.C., Caracas, Venezuela (made for Universal Exhibition of Brussels, 1958).\\r\\n1967: \"Volume suspendu\", Expo 67, Pavililon of Venezuela, Montreal, Canada (ephemeral environment in the pavilion made by architect Carlos Ra�l Villanueva for int�gration of Soto\\'s monumental artwork, Universal Exhibition in Montr�al, 1967).\\r\\n1968-69: \\'\\' Ephemeral Environment\\'\\' made for the end year festivities, Place Furstenberg, Paris, France.\\r\\n1969: \"Mur cin�tique\" (2), UNESCO, Paris, France. \"Progresi�n a centro m�vil\", Torre Capriles, Caracas, Venezuela. \"Paralelas vibrantes\", Torre Capriles, Caracas, Venezuela. \"Volumen cin�tico\", Torre Capriles, Caracas, Venezuela.\\r\\n1970: Hall, Deutsche Bundesbank, Francfort, Germany. \"Extension et progression dans l\\'eau\", Rethel college, The Ardennes, France.

In 2010 it fell to the 131st place; according to Reporters Without Borders this was the result of \"the slow and steady deterioration in press freedom since Viktor Yanukovych\\'s election as president in February\". In 2013 Ukraine occupied the 126th spot (dropping 10 places compared with 2012); (according to Reporters Without Borders) \"the worst record for the media since the Orange Revolution in 2004\". In the 2017 World Press Freedom Index Ukraine was placed 102nd.\\r\\nDuring an opinion poll by Research & Branding Group in October 2009 49.2% of the respondents stated that Ukraine\\'s level of freedom of speech was sufficient, and 19.6% said the opposite. Another 24.2% said that there was too much of freedom of speech in Ukraine. According to the data, 62% of respondents in western Ukraine considered the level of freedom of speech sufficient, and in the central and southeastern regions the figures were 44% and 47%, respectively.\\r\\nIn a late 2010 poll also conducted by the Research & Branding Group 56% of all Ukrainians trusted the media and 38.5% didn\\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\nKuchma presidencies (1994–2004)\\r\\nAfter the (only) term of office of the first Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk ended in 1994, the freedom of the press worsened. During the presidency of Leonid Kuchma (1994–2004) several news-outlets critical to him were forcefully closed. In 1999 the Committee to Protect Journalists placed Kuchma on the list of worst enemies of the press. In that year the Ukrainian Government partially limited freedom of the press through tax inspections (Mykola Azarov, who later became Prime Minister of Ukraine, headed the tax authority during Kuchma\\'s presidency), libel cases, subsidization, and intimidation of journalists; this caused many journalists to practice self-censorship. In 2003 and 2004 authorities interfered with the media by issuing written and oral instructions about what events to cover. Toward the very end of the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election campaign in November 2004, many media outlets began to ignore government direction and covered events in a more objective, professional manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrange revolution and Yushchenko presidency (2004–2010)\\r\\nSince the Orange Revolution (of 2004) Ukrainian media have become more pluralistic and independent. For instance, attempts by authorities to limit freedom of the press through tax inspections have ceased. Since then the Ukrainian press is considered to be among the freest of all post-Soviet states (only the Baltic states are considered \"free\").\\r\\nAfter the 2005 Orange Revolution, Ukrainian television became more free. In February 2009 the National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting claimed that \"political pressure on mass media increased in recent times through amending laws and other normative acts to strengthen influence on mass media and regulatory bodies in this sphere\".\\r\\nIn 2007, in Ukraine\\'s provinces numerous, anonymous attacks and threats persisted against journalists, who investigated or exposed corruption or other government misdeeds. The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists concluded in 2007 that these attacks, and police reluctance in some cases to pursue the perpetrators, were \"helping to foster an atmosphere of impunity against independent journalists.\"\\r\\nIn Ukraine\\'s provinces numerous, anonymous attacks and threats persisted against journalists, who investigated or exposed corruption or other government misdeeds. The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists concluded in 2007 that these attacks, and police reluctance in some cases to pursue the perpetrators, were \"helping to foster an atmosphere of impunity against independent journalists.\" Media watchdogs have stated attacks and pressure on journalists have increased since the February 2010 election of Viktor Yanukovych as President.\\r\\nIn December 2009, and during the 2010 Ukrainian presidential election, campaign incumbent Prime Minister of Ukraine and presidential candidate Yulia Tymoshenko complained Ukrainian TV channels are manipulating the consciousness of citizens in favor of financial and oligarchic groups. As of January 2009, Ukrainian Prime Minister, Yulia Tymoshenko refused to appear in Inter TV-programmes \"until journalists, management and owners of the TV channel stop destroying the freedom of speech and until they remember the essence of their profession - honesty, objectiveness, and unbiased stand\".\\r\\n\\r\\nYanukovych presidency (2010-2013)\\r\\nSince Viktor Yanukovych was elected President of Ukraine in February 2010 Ukrainian journalists and international journalistic watchdogs (including the European Federation of Journalists and Reporters Without Borders) have complained about a deterioration of press freedom in Ukraine. Yanukovych responded (in May 2010) that he \"deeply values press freedom\" and that \"free, independent media that must ensure society\\'s unimpeded access to information\". Anonymous journalists stated early May 2010 that they were voluntarily tailoring their coverage so as not to offend the Yanukovych administration and the Azarov Government. The Azarov Government denies censoring the media, so did the Presidential Administration and President Yanukovych himself. Presidential Administration Deputy Head Hanna Herman stated on 13 May 2010 that the opposition benefited from discussions about the freedom of the press in Ukraine and also suggested that the recent reaction of foreign journalists organizations had been provoked by the opposition. On 12 May 2010, the parliamentary committee for freedom of speech and information called on the General Prosecutor\\'s Office to immediately investigate complaints by journalists of pressure on journalists and censorship. Also in May 2010 the Stop Censorship movement was founded by more than 500 journalist.\\r\\nA law on strengthening the protection of the ownership of mass media offices, publishing houses, bookshops and distributors, as well as creative unions was passed by the Ukrainian Parliament on 20 May 2010.\\r\\nSince the February 2010 election of Viktor Yanukovych as President Media watchdogs have stated attacks and pressure on journalists have increased. The International Press Institute addressed an open letter to President Yanukovych on 10 August 2010 urging him to address what the organisation saw as a disturbing deterioration in press freedom over the previous six months in Ukraine. PACE rapporteur Renate Wohlwend noticed on 6 October 2010 that \"Some progress had been made in recent years but there had also been some retrograde steps\". In January 2011 Freedom House stated it had perceived \"negative trends in Ukraine\" during 2010; these included: curbs on press freedom, the intimidation of civil society, and greater government influence on the judiciary.\\r\\nAccording to the US Department of State in 2009 there were no attempts by central authorities to direct media content, but there were reports of intimidation of journalists by national and local officials. Media at times demonstrated a tendency toward self‑censorship on matters that the government deemed sensitive. Stories in the electronic and printed media (veiled advertisements and positive coverage presented as news) and participation in a television talk show can be bought. Media watchdog groups have express concern over the extremely high monetary damages that were demanded in court cases concerning libel.\\r\\nIn 2013 there were concerns over the corrupting influence of certain political figures, connected to the government of Viktor Yanukovych on Ukrainian media.\\r\\n\\r\\nEuromaidan revolution and Poroshenko presidency (2014-2019)\\r\\nA May 2014 report from the OSCE found approximately 300 instances of perceived violent attacks on the media in Ukraine since November 2013. The Ukrainian NGO Institute of Mass Information recorded at least 995 violations of free speech in 2014 - the double than in 2013 (496) and triple than in 2012 (324). Most attacks on journalists happened during the euromaidan period in Kyiv (82 in January, 70 in February 2014). 78 journalists were abducted and illegally detained by various groups in 2014 - a new category of professional risk; 20 such cases happened in Donetsk in April 2014. \\r\\nIn 2014 restrictions to press freedom in Ukraine included police impeding access to public buildings, physical attacks on press rooms, and cyberattacks (e.g. against the Glavnoe, Gordon and UNIAN websites); in July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel 112 Ukraine.\\r\\nPolitical interference in the media sector greatly diminished after the flight of Yanukovych from Ukraine, with media outlets almost immediately starting to openly discuss the events of the previous months, including the moments of violence, which had previously been censored or self-censored through pressures on owners and managers. The 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election was covered with a wide variety of political orientations in the media. Minor cases of pressures or censorship attempts were reported in 2014 too.  In Kirovohrad in December 2014 a regional politician ordered a subordinate to review the Zorya newspaper before its publication.\\r\\nCensorship issues were debated in 2015 concerning aggressive propaganda from Russian state-owned news outlets to support the Russian annexation of Crimea, encourage separatism in Donbas and discredit the Kyiv government. Creating some concern among Western human rights monitors was that under the impact of war and perceived extreme social polarization the Ukrainian government has been accused of cracking down on pro-separatist points of view. For example, Ukraine also shut down most Russia-based television stations on the grounds that they purvey \"propaganda,\" and barred a growing list of Russian journalists from entering the country.\\r\\nThe Ministry of Information Policy was established on 2 December 2014. The ministry oversees information policy in Ukraine. According to the first Minister of Information, Yuriy Stets, one of the goals of its formation was to counteract \"Russian information aggression\" amidst pro-Russian unrest across Ukraine, and the ongoing war in the Donbas region. Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko said that the main function of the ministry is to stop \"the spreading of biased information about Ukraine\".\\r\\nOn 16 May 2017 president Poroshenko signed a decree banning various Russian internet service providers and news sources, among others, VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Yandex, Rossiya Segodnya, RBC, VGTRK, but also a number of independent stations such as the RBC, claiming this was done for \"security reasons\". Tanya Cooper from Human Rights Watch called the decree: \"a cynical, politically expedient attack on the right to information affecting millions of Ukrainians, and their personal and professional lives\". Reporters Without Borders (RSF) also condemned the ban imposed on Russian social networks.\\r\\nSince November 2015 Ukrainian authorities, state agencies and local government authorities are forbidden to act as founders (or cofounders) of printed media outlets.\\r\\nFreedom House reported the status of press freedom in Ukraine in 2015 as improving from Not Free to Partly Free. It justified the change as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\ndue to profound changes in the media environment after the fall of President Viktor Yanukovych\\'s government in February, despite a rise in attacks on journalists during the Euromaidan protests of early 2014 and the subsequent conflict in eastern Ukraine. The level of government hostility and legal pressure faced by journalists decreased, as did political pressure on state-owned outlets. The media also benefited from improvements to the law on access to information and the increased independence of the broadcasting regulator.\\r\\nIn 2015 the main concerns about media freedom in Ukraine concern the handling of pro-Russian propaganda, the concentration of media ownership, and the high risks of violence against journalists, especially in the conflict areas in the east. In September 2015 Freedom House classified the Internet in Ukraine as \"partly free\" and the press as \"partly free\". Ukraine was in 102nd place out of 180 countries listed in the 2017 World Press Freedom Index. In 2017 organizations like Reporters Without Borders, Human Rights Watch and Committee to Protect Journalists condemned then Poroshenko\\'s government recent bans on media.\\r\\n\\r\\nRussian invasion and Zelensky presidency (2019-present)\\r\\nOn March 3, 2022, the Criminal Code of Ukraine was supplemented by Article 436-2, titled \"Justification, recognition as legitimate, denial of the armed aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, glorification of its participants\". The article, which has been criticized by the OHCHR and other human rights groups, states punishment by correctional labor up to two years or imprisonment up to eight years for such speech. Gonzalo Lira, an American pro-Russia blogger living in Ukraine, was among those arrested under this law.\\r\\nOn December 30, 2022, President Volodymyr Zelensky signed into law a bill that would expand the power of government to regulate media outlets and journalists in the country, over the objections of journalists and international press freedom groups.\\r\\nAccording to a State Department report published in 2023 restrictions were placed on media freedoms enabling \"an unprecedented level of control over primetime television news.\" Some speakers who criticised the government were blacklisted from government-directed news. The outlets and journalists who were considered a threat to the national security and who undermined the country\\'s sovereignty and territorial integrity according to the authorities were blocked, banned or sanctioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nPress freedom scores as perceived by Freedom House\\r\\nThe following table shows press freedom scores calculated each year by a foreign non-governmental organisation called Freedom House.  The year is the year of issue, and data relate to the previous year.\\r\\n\\r\\nScore 0–30 = press were free.\\r\\nScore 31–60 = press were partly free.\\r\\nScore 61–100 = press were not free.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttacks and threats against journalists\\r\\nUkraine was one of the most dangerous places for journalists in the world during the Euromaidan demonstrations and the war in Donbas. A May 2014 report from the OSCE found approximately 300 instances of perceived violent attacks on the media in Ukraine since November 2013. 78 journalists were abducted and illegally detained by various groups in 2014 - a new category of professional risk; 20 such cases happened in Donetsk in April 2014. In July 2014 a firebomb was thrown at the TV channel 112 Ukraine. In September 2016 Inter TV channel - often accused of being pro-Russia - was put to fire during a protest.\\r\\nAmnesty International has appealed for the release of Ukrainian journalist Ruslan Kotsaba and declared him a prisoner of conscience.\\r\\nThe website Myrotvorets has published personal information about journalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nTimeline of reporters killed in Ukraine\\r\\nUnder former President Leonid Kuchma opposition papers were closed and several journalists died in mysterious circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nMissing reporters\\r\\nSergei Dolgov, a newspaper editor from Mariupol, went missing in June 2014 during the war in Donbas and is presumed dead by some mostly pro-Russian sources.\\r\\n\\r\\nBanned journalists, media, websites\\r\\nThe Ukrainian government and President Petro Poroshenko have banned journalists, media and websites. In May 2017 Ukraine banned 19 Russian news sites and 13 journalists, those being \"most official Russian news outlets and others sympathetic to Moscow, but also a number of independent stations such as the RBC.\" The decision was condemned by Reporters Without Borders, Human Rights Watch and Committee to Protect Journalists. The most well known included:\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterature\\r\\nThe Government of Ukraine started banning books in 2016 that a special committee (State Committee for State TV and Radio Broadcasting\\'s licensing and distribution-control department) had determined to contain anti-Ukrainian content.\\r\\nIn January 2018, the Russian version of British historian Antony Beevor\\'s Stalingrad was added to this list. The head of the committee, Serhiy Oliyinyk, told Radio Free Europe that one particular reason was that Beevor had included information about Ukrainian militia killing 90 Jewish children on orders of the SS \"to save the feelings of the Sonderkommando.\" He claimed this had never been confirmed at post-war trials and was taken from Soviet sources. Beevor strongly criticized the ban and said the source was actually German resistance fighter Helmuth Groscurth. \"It\\'s utterly outrageous. They have no reason for doing it. It\\'s quite clear both in the Russian edition and English edition what the source was and where it came from – this rather brave and religious officer [Groscurth] who protested strongly, despite threats he would be reported to Himmler ... about this massacre of the children. There\\'s no way the Soviets would even have known about it.\" It was also strongly criticized by the Ukraine-based Human Rights in Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternet censorship and surveillance\\r\\nIn December 2010 the OpenNet Initiative found little or no evidence of Internet filtering in all four areas (political, social, conflict/security, and Internet tools) for which they test.\\r\\nIn its Freedom on the Net report covering the period May 2012 through April 2013, Freedom House found the Internet in Ukraine to be \"largely unhindered\" and rated the Internet in Ukraine as \"Free\" with an overall score of 28 on a scale from 0 (most free) to 100 (least free). The report said that \"there is no practice of institutionalized blocking or filtering, or a regulatory framework for censorship of content online\", but \"there have been attempts at creating legislation which could censor or limit content\" and would \"present indirect threats to freedom of information online.\"\\r\\nAs of 2012, access to Internet content in Ukraine was largely unfettered. Ukraine possessed relatively liberal legislation governing the Internet and access to information. While there were no government restrictions on access to the Internet, law enforcement bodies were known to monitor the Internet, at times without appropriate legal authority. There have been occasional agitations of interference by law enforcement agencies with prominent bloggers and online publications.\\r\\nIn 2014 it was reported that the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) asked the Ukrainian Internet Association (UIA) to block a list of websites accused of \"promote war, ethnic hatred, and violent change in the constitutional order or territorial integrity of Ukraine.\" Such orders should, however, come from courts of law and not security agencies.\\r\\nOn 16 May 2017, President Poroshenko signed a decree requiring providers to block access to a number of Russian websites including four of the most popular websites in Ukraine: VKontakte, Odnoklassniki, Yandex and Mail.Ru. The president claimed they participated in an information war against Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nSituation in the Russian-annexed Crimea\\r\\nThe media environment in Crimea was completely transformed by the March 2014 Russian annexation of the peninsula, after the ejection of Viktor Yanukovych from power in Ukraine following the euromaidan protests. Russian authorities engineered an annexation referendum to Russia, and restrictive Russian media laws started to be enacted in the Black Sea peninsula too. Media conditions in Crimea in 2014 were worse than in Russia itself, due to the effort of Russia-imposed authorities to rein in a previously relatively pluralistic media landscape. Media outlets were shut down, broadcasts of Ukrainian channels were suspended, and journalists fled the region due to fears of harassment, violence, and arrests. The situation of press freedom in Crimea in 2014 was identified by Freedom House as the worst in the European continent.\\r\\nRussian outlets, particularly state-owned ones, enjoy a dominant position in post-annexation Crimea. The distribution of Ukrainian print media has been obstructed by Russian officials, and even the Ukrainian Postal Agency had to stop deliveries in the peninsula. Widespread and irregular expropriations by Russian authorities have also affected the Crimean media landscape\\r\\nFree access to the internet in Crimea was threatened by Russian authorities. Rostelecom laid a cable under the Kerch strait and provided online services in the peninsula starting from July 2014. Since August 2014, mobile phone services by Ukrainian carriers were disrupted and replaced by Russian companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegal framework\\r\\nAfter the annexation, Russian authorities passed a local constitution on the Russian model and started imposing Russian legislation. Despite guarantees for freedom of speech and freedom of the press in the Russian legislation, politicised judiciary and restrictive laws devoid them of actual contents, leaving broad discretion to federal regulators in media registration and licensing.\\r\\nAll media in Crimea, including online ones, were afforded until January 2015 to register with the Russian federal media regulator Rozkomnadzor and get a license. Officials warned editors that registration would be denied to media that spread \"extremist\" contents. A December 2013 Russian law against separatism (carrying sanctions of up to 5 years in prison) was used to repress criticism of the annexation and calls for a return of the territory to Ukraine.\\r\\nNGOs, journalists\\' associations and citizen groups in Crimea became subject to restrictive Russian laws, including measures limiting foreign funding.\\r\\nRussian authorities failed to protect journalists, activists and citizens from abuses by paramilitaries and security forces. Cases of unlawful detentions and physical assaults were reported throughout 2014 in Crimea.\\r\\n\\r\\nAttacks and threats against journalists\\r\\nSince the annexation, Russian authorities threatened and harassed pro-Ukrainian or simply independent media in Crimea. Media professionals - including foreign ones - have been obstructed, detained, questioned, and have had their equipment seized or destroyed. \"Self-defence\" paramilitary units have enjoyed impunity for their punitive actions against non-aligned journalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2014 paramilitaries stopped Sergey Mokrushin and Vladen Melnikov (of the Centre for Investigative Journalism) on the streets of Simferopol for singing an anti-Putin song. The two were detained and badly beaten, then passed to the police, who released them.\\r\\nRuslan Yugosh, among the founders of the Sobytiya Kryma (Crimean Events) news website, was summoned by the police in June 2014. In his absence from Crimea, the police interrogated his 73-years-old mother, threatening her with repercussions related to Yugosh\\' work.\\r\\nSeveral human rights and civic activists chose to relocate to mainland Ukraine to escape restrictions, intimidation and harassment, providing information to the Crimean public via the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe independent TV and radio station Chornomorska moved to the mainland after being forced off-air in March 2014 and having its equipment seized under the pretext of failure to pay fees.\\r\\nThe anti-annexation blogger Yelizaveta Bohutskaya left Crimea in September 2014 after a police raid at her home. She had been questioned for six hours and had had her equipment seized.\\r\\nRadio Free Europe/Radio Liberty created a Crimean news service in Russian, Ukrainian and Tatar languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepression of Crimean Tatar media\\r\\nCrimean Tatar media were particularly targeted by Russian repression.  ATR, Avdet and the QHA news agency remained among the last independent media operating in Crimea by the end of 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn June 2014 Shevket Kaybullayev, editor of the Avdet newspaper, was questioned and warned by the prosecutor over \"extremist contents\" due to the paper\\'s coverage of an opposition activities and the use of the term \"occupation\". In September 2014 the premises of the Avdet newspaper were raided and searched by unidentified security forces, without a warrant. The newspaper was closed down and its bank accounts seized. Kaybullayev was officially warned that he would be prosecuted and risked up to 5 years in jail if Avdet had continued reporting on calls for a boycott of the 2014 Crimean legislative election.\\r\\nThe Crimean Tatar TV channel ATR received a warning in May 2015 after covering a Tatar protest. It was subject to an inspection in September 2014 by the Interior Ministry, as suspect of inciting \"extremism\" and \"distrust towards the authorities\". KGB agents regularly called the station and applied pressures, threatening it with closure.\\r\\n\\r\\nSituation in the occupied regions of Donetsk and Luhansk\\r\\nSeven journalists and media workers were killed in Ukraine in 2014. One of them, Vyacheslav Veremiy of Vesti, was shot in Kyiv in February 2014. The others died in the conflict areas in the east. (According to the Prosecutor General of Ukraine\\'s Office, Veremiy\\'s murderer was Jalal Aliyev. Who, according to unofficial information, was killed in Horlivka in July 2015 fighting for the Donetsk People\\'s Republic.)\\r\\nIn Donetsk and Luhansk, Russian-backed separatists seized control of broadcasting infrastructure, replacing Ukrainian channels with Russian pro-Kremlin channels in both on-air and cable transmissions.\\r\\nIn July 2014, pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk tried to deter journalists from covering the downing of the MH17 airliner by threatening them with arbitrary detention and intimidation.\\r\\n\\r\\nTransparency of media ownership\\r\\nTransparency of media ownership refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures. A legal regime guaranteeing transparency of media ownership makes possible for the public as well as for media authorities to find out who effectively owns, controls and influences the media as well as media influence on political parties or state bodies.\\r\\nThe lack of transparency on media ownership has typically been a negative trait of the Ukrainian media system. In 2005 Ukraine committed itself to the Council of Europe to introduce a law for ensuring transparency of media ownership, according to the Resolution 1466 (2005)1 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.\\r\\nIn 2014, the European Commission\\'s progress report on the implementation of the European Neighbourhood Policy in Ukraine found the lack of transparency as an issue in the country and that proper legislative framework should be adopted. To comply with its international commitment, legislation on transparency of media ownership has been reformed in 2015. On 10 September 2015, President Petro Poroshenko signed the law called \"On Amendments to Several Laws of Ukraine on Ensuring the Transparency of Media Ownership and Implementing the Principles of state Policy in the Sphere of Television and Radio Broadcasting\". The law entered into force on 1 October 2015.\\r\\nThe new legal system regulating transparency of media ownership, which establishes a detailed system for guaranteeing transparency, has been appraised for its level of innovation by many international organisations and experts but still the effectiveness of its implementation remains to be seen. In general terms, the new regulation obliges broadcasts and program service providers to make public detailed information about their ownership structures and final beneficiaries. These requirements apply to the audiovisual sector (TV and radio), print and information agencies but not to online publications. Also, the amendments prevent businesses and individuals registered offshore from establishing and owning broadcast companies and program service providers in Ukraine. Moreover, the new law sets forth new financial disclosure rules for owners.\\r\\nSpecifically, the new law amends article 12 of the existing Law of Ukraine on Television and Radio Broadcasting of 1994, establishing that national and local government authorities, individuals and legal entities which are registered offline, political parties, religious organisations, professional unions, and persons that were convicted by courts and that are still serving their sentences cannot be owners of a TV or radio stations in Ukraine. Furthermore, the Law prohibits to physical or legal persons residing in a country which is recognised as an aggressor or occupier the right to own a television or a radio station in Ukraine. This sentence refers to the Russian Federation which annexed Crimea in 2014. The Law provides a new definition of ownership which is closely connected to the exercise of a decisive influence in the management or business activity of the media outlet directly or through other persons and includes also final beneficiaries. The Law requires that information on the ownership structure and on the individuals owning at least 10% or more of a television or radio broadcasting have to be made public on the company\\'s website and sent to the National Council for Questions of Television and Radio Broadcasting, which is the national media regulator in Ukraine. According to the law, the council can impose fines when information provided are insufficient or incorrect.\\r\\nAccording to some experts, one of the main weakness of the new law is that it does not exclude funding from financial sources located in Cyprus (even if it prohibits the transfer of funds from offshore territories), through which ownership of most Ukrainian TV channels is exercised. Among some commentators there are some doubts that the Law will be amended to address this issue, due to the strong lobbying efforts of TV owners. Other doubts have been voiced due to the lack of an effective sanctions system.\\r\\nIn 2016, Reporters Without Borders, together with the Institute of Mass Information (Kyiv), launched the project Media Ownership Monitor Ukraine to promote transparency in media ownership and to map who owns and controls the media in Ukraine, by creating a public available and updated database listing the owners of the main media outlets, and detailing also the interests and the affilitations of owners into companies or political parties.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nHuman rights in Ukraine\\r\\nInternet censorship and surveillance in Ukraine\\r\\nList of newspapers in Ukraine\\r\\nMedia of Ukraine\\r\\nTelecommunications in Ukraine\\r\\nTelevision in Ukraine\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nUkraine CCTV: Masked mob savages Russian-language newspaper office in Kyiv on YouTube, 6 July 2014.', 'Kudjoe Affutu (born 1985) is a Ghanaian artist and figurative coffin and palanquin builder.

Miles O\\'Reilly) (20 November 1829 – 3 August 1868) was an Irish journalist, author and soldier during the American Civil War.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and family\\r\\nBorn at Oldcastle, County Meath, on 20 November 1829. Halpine was son of the Anne (née Grehan) and Rev. Nicholas John Halpin. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, until 1846, was originally intended for the medical profession, but he preferred the law, and in his leisure wrote for the press. The sudden death of his father and his own early marriage compelled him to adopt journalism as a profession.\\r\\nOn 25 January 1849, Halpine married Margaret Grace Milligan. They had a number of children, including Syble, Lucie, and Lonnie. Syble was born in Ireland, and remained there with her mother and her family when Halpine emigrated to the United States in 1851. They later joined Halpine. One of their daughters married the writer, Eugene Davis.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nIn 1851 he emigrated to the United States, and took up his residence at Boston, where he became assistant editor of The Boston Post, and, with Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber, commenced a humorous journal called The Carpet Bag, which was unsuccessful. He afterwards resided at Washington, where he acted as the correspondent of The New York Times. Removing to New York he secured employment on the Herald, and in a few months established relations with several periodicals. He undertook a great variety of literary work, most of which was entirely ephemeral. He next became associate editor of the ‘New York Times,’ for which paper in 1855 and 1856 he wrote the Nicaragua correspondence at the time of William Walker\\'s filibustering expedition. In 1857 he became principal editor and part proprietor of the New York Leader, which under his management rapidly increased in circulation.\\r\\nAt the beginning of the American Civil War in April 1861, he enlisted in the 69th New York infantry, in which he was soon elected a lieutenant, and served during the three months for which he had volunteered. He was then transferred to the staff of General David Hunter as assistant-adjutant-general with the rank of major, and soon after went with that officer to Missouri to relieve General John Charles Fremont. He accompanied General Hunter to Hilton Head, and while there wrote a series of burlesque poems in the assumed character of an Irish private. Several of them were contributed to the New York Herald in 1862 under the pseudonym of \"Miles O\\'Reilly\", and with additional articles were issued in two volumes entitled Life and Adventures, Songs, Services, and Speeches of Private Miles O\\'Reilly, 47th Regiment New York Volunteers, 1864, and Baked Meats of the Funeral, a Collection of Essays, Poems, Speeches, and Banquets, by Private Miles O\\'Reilly, late of the 47th Regiment New York Volunteer Infantry, 10th Army Corps. Collected, revised, and edited, with the requisite corrections of punctuation, spelling, and grammar, by an Ex-Colonel of the Adjutant-General\\'s Department, with whom the Private formerly served as Lance-Corporal of Orderlies, 1866.\\r\\nHalpine was subsequently assistant-adjutant-general on General Henry W. Halleck\\'s staff with the rank of colonel in 1862, and accompanied General David Hunter as a staff-officer on his expedition up the Shenandoah valley in the spring of 1864. On his return to New York he resigned his commission in consequence of his bad eyesight, receiving the brevet of brigadier-general of volunteers.\\r\\nHe then made New York his home, and resuming his literary work became editor, and later on proprietor of the Citizen, a newspaper issued by the citizens\\' association to advocate reforms in the civil administration of New York city. In 1867 he was elected registrar of the county of New York by a coalition of republicans and democrats. Incessant labour brought on insomnia. He had recourse to opiates, and his death in New York city on 3 August 1868 was caused by an undiluted dose of chloroform. His widow later successfully petitioned for a pension to support his \"several minor children\" from the United States government.\\r\\nBesides the books above mentioned he was the author of Lyrics by the Letter H, 1854.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nHanchett, William. \"IRISH: Charles G.

In 1982, Prensa editor Carlos Ernesto González was sentenced to five months\\' imprisonment for an article critical of President Aristedes Royo, in which he accused the president of being behind the gunshots fired at the Prensa building by Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) supporters.\\r\\nIn 1986, La Prensa was the only newspaper to publish reports critical of military leader Manuel Noriega; the government consequently adopted a formal resolution condemning Eisenmann as a \"traitor to the nation\". Eisenmann then reportedly lived in exile in the U.S. for fear of his safety, first in Massachusetts as a Nieman Fellow of Harvard University, and then in Miami, Florida.\\r\\nOn July 2, 1987, PRD supporters burned down Mansion Dante, a commercial complex owned by the Eisenmann family.\\r\\nOn July 26, security forces entered the building with an order to close La Prensa signed by Governor of Panama Alberto Velázquez; two smaller opposition papers were also closed. La Prensa remained closed for six months, putting out its next issue on January 20, 1988.\\r\\nThe paper was occupied and closed by government troops again in 1988, remaining closed until after the December 1989 United States invasion of Panama. During the invasion, the U.S. Army stated that it found documents from opponents of the regime—ranging from Eisenmann to U.S. presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush—being used in apparent Santería rituals against them. The paper reopened in January 1990. Eisenmann called the issue \"the first La Prensa that we have ever published without threat, without being under the gun\".\\r\\n\\r\\nUnder civilian rule\\r\\nFollowing democratic reforms, La Prensa continued to report on politics and government corruption. In the 1994 presidential election, the paper opposed Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares—the election\\'s eventual winner—stating in editorials that he was a threat to the country\\'s post-dictatorship democracy.\\r\\nPeruvian journalist Gustavo Gorriti joined the investigative staff, and after a series of articles reporting on the connections between drug traffickers and the PRD, had his work visa rejected by the Panamanian government and was charged with defamation by Attorney General José Antonio Sossa for an article about Sossa himself.\\r\\nIn 1999, Eisenmann served as an informal advisor to the administration of President Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party.\\r\\nIn March 2001, Pérez Balladares\\' former foreign minister, Ricardo Alberto Arias, forced out Gorriti and was elected La Prensa\\'s new president by a majority of shareholders. The Committee to Protect Journalists, which had awarded Gorriti its International Press Freedom Award for his work with the paper, called the election, and the resignations and demotions of investigative staff that followed, a \"boardroom coup\" that left \"the once feisty paper a shadow of its former self\".\\r\\nEisenmann went on to work for a non-governmental organization.\\r\\nIn 2004, former Attorney General Sossa filed a criminal complaint for defamation against Eisenmann after he accused Sossa in a Prensa column of \"protecting criminals and filing charges against journalists\". Eisenmann was barred from leaving the country, and after refusing to answer questions on the case in court, was declared in contempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards\\r\\nIn 1995, Eisenmann was awarded a special citation of the Maria Moors Cabot Prize for \"promoting press freedom and inter-American understanding\".\\r\\nOn July 4, 2014, the Inter American Press Association (SIP) established between its annual awards for journalistic excellence Environmental Journalism category, under the name I.

He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature twelve times.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nJuhani Aho was born at Lapinlahti in 1861. His parents were Henrik Gustaf Theodor Brofeldt and Karolina Fredrika Emelie \"Emma\" Brofeldt (née Snellman). The Brofeldts were a priestly family: Theodor was a relatively well-known revivalist preacher whose sermons were published in 1917 as Rovasti H. G. Th. Brofeldtin saarnoja and his father had been a chaplain and his grandfather a vicar. Juhani had two younger brothers Kaarlo Kustaa Brofeldt (1865–1936) and Petter Fredrik Brofeldt (1864–1945) who, following Juhani\\'s example, adopted the Finnish names Kalle and Pekka as well as the surname Aho.  \\r\\nFrom 1872 to 1880 Juhani Aho attended the Kuopion Lyseo, one of the few upper secondary schools offering education in Finnish. During his time at the school he adopted the pen name Juhani Aho for many of his school works. In the 1880s he studied at the University of Helsinki and was associated with political radicals. His literary pursuits were aided by Elisabeth Järnefelt and her circle, the \"Järnefelt school\", who were pioneers of Finnish realism.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nAho\\'s literary output is wide-ranging since he pursued different styles as time passed.\\r\\nHe started as a realist and his first novel Rautatie (Railroad, 1884), which is considered one of his main works, is from this period. Later he moved towards neoromanticism with novels Panu and Kevät ja takatalvi as well as Juha. The last one is one of his most famous works and has been twice as adapted an opera, by Aarre Merikanto and by Leevi Madetoja, and to film four times, most recently in 1999 by Aki Kaurismäki.\\r\\nHis novel Yksin (Alone), published in 1890, controversially bold by the standards of Finnish literature in that epoch, is a roman à clef. Its tale of unrequited love is the autobiographical novel of Aho\\'s passion for Aino Järnefelt who, at that time, was secretly engaged to Jean Sibelius, whom she would later marry. The initial feelings of anger and jealousy that reading the novel provoked in Sibelius were soon forgotten and, in later life, Aho and Sibelius were close friends as well as neighbours in Järvenpää, where the composer had a villa christened \"Ainola\" (the Place of Aino). Aho married Venny Soldan-Brofeldt in 1891.\\r\\nIn addition to his novels Aho wrote a number of short stories of distinct style, called \"splinters\" (\"lastuja\" in Finnish). Their topics could vary from political allegories to depictions of everyday life.\\r\\nThe first and most famous of the short stories is Siihen aikaan kun isä lampun osti (When Father Brought Home the Lamp), depicting the effect of the innovation on people living in the countryside. Nowadays the title is a Finnish saying used when something related to new technology is introduced.\\r\\nAho was one of the founders of Päivälehti, the predecessor of the biggest newspaper in Finland today, Helsingin Sanomat. He was also one of the active contributors of a cultural magazine, Valvoja.\\r\\nAho loved fly fishing. In 1906 he got to know Huopanankoski rapids in Viitasaari. After that he went there every spring and autumn for 14 years. He also went summers in Laukkoski, Pornainen.\\r\\nAho died in Helsinki in 1921.

Previously to his career as an artist, Aguilera was awarded the sixth Dan in Kung Fu when he was just 26 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nAguilera was born in Catia, one of the poor neighborhoods surrounding Caracas. His mother died at birth and he was raised by his grandmother and other relatives. At age 6, he was making a living as a shoe polisher while attending primary school. After graduating from high school in 1978 from the Colegio San Agustin, Julio studied at the Instituto Pedagógico de Caracas.\\r\\nAguilera was inclined towards the arts since he was in primary school, and he began painting at a young age after a local painter gave him a handful of used brushes and half-empty tubes of oil paint. However strong, his artistic inclinations had to take a back seat for several years while Aguilera struggled to move out of the slums. During this time, he painted mostly for enjoyment, giving away his canvases to friends and relatives while he made his way through school. While at the Instituto Pedagógico, Julio enrolled himself in the academy of Chan Lee Kam Fai, one of Venezuela\\'s most renowned martial arts training academies., unbeknownst Julio, he would later become the future president of the Venezuelan Federation of Chinese Martial Arts and the International Hung Sing Choy Li Fat Chan Kim Fay. This decision temporarily separated him from his artistic career due to the success he would enjoy as a martial artist.\\r\\nIn July, 1978, Aguilera earned the black belt in the Choy Lay Fut Kung-Fu style, and during that and the following year he participated in several international competitions and exhibitions, including the Muay Thai World Championship in Manila, Philippines, the Barehand Championship in China and the International Martial Arts Open of Puerto Rico, which he won in 1979. From that year until 1981, he stayed on the Caribbean island, working as a trainer in Santurce, until he was handpicked to co-develop in Venezuela Top Spa Gym at the time the most successful gym in Caracas, located in Las Mercedes sector of the city. Two years later, he was part of the Venezuelan Martial Arts team at the 1983 Pan American Games in the same city.\\r\\nIn 1983, Aguilera met and married Janice Tuohy, an American choreographer working in the local theater and TV industry. With Touht he opened a multidisciplinary academy with dancing and languages training directed by Touht herself and other Venezuelan professionals such as Anita Vivas, Antonio Drija and Betty Kaplan. The academy didn\\'t last a year and in 1984, Julio and his wife moved to the United States.\\r\\nAfter a brief stay in New York City, in 1985 Julio moved to Diamond Bar, California, and opened another martial arts academy under the name \"Eagle Lighting\". This time, the business was a success and in a few years he opened other branches in Marina del Rey, San José and Sacramento. It was while he taught Martial Arts in California that he won the Bare Hand Kung-Fu World Championship in August 1987. That same month, he was awarded the 6th Dan in China Kung-Fu, I Ching Kung-Fu by the International Kung Fu Federation.  Despite all those achievements, Aguilera retired from Martial Arts in 1987, closed down the academies and moved to New York City with his wife. During the following years he flirted with corporate America and the tried opening a few businesses himself, but the Californian success didn\\'t repeat in New York City, where he divorced Janice Touht in 2001.\\r\\nDuring his years in California, Julio always kept a studio inside the academy, where he painted with lukewarm success. After the several failed business ventures, he began painting professionally around 1997. That year, he bought fifty canvases and in three months developed what is known as the Blue Series. Aguilera promoted these pieces through web forums and the Venezuelan Consulate in New York, and by 2000 his work had been exhibited in Spain, Argentina and Venezuela in sold-out shows.\\r\\nAfter a show in the Venezuelan Consulate in 2003, Julio was appointed as the Venezuelan Cultural Attaché in New York City, a position he held until 2006. At the same time, he became the General Manager of the El Nuevo Cojo Ilustrado a Hispanic  general interest magazine based in Harlem, and started to experiment with bronze, producing a series of statues from his studio in New Jersey.\\r\\nAbout his art, critics are uniform about Aguilera\\'s style. He\\'s unashamed about the influence of Picasso and other Spanish master like Goya, El Greco and Velázquez. And according to the art critic Ed McCormack, Managing Editor of Gallery & Studio Magazine, \"more than any other artist in the Hispanic Diaspora, Aguilera has brought new blood, so to speak, to that still vital tradition, which came to encompass not only the spirit of Spain but all the antique cultural booty that the canny old pirate, Picasso, looted from France Italy and the North.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRecent exhibitions\\r\\n2019 - Red Dot at Art Basel Miami, Miami, Florida\\r\\n2016 - Art Basel Extension Calle 8, Miami, Florida\\r\\n2016 - Art Basel, Miami, Florida\\r\\n2015 - Afropolis in Gardens Art Basel, Miami Gardens, Florida\\r\\n2015 - Mana Art Basel, Miami, Florida\\r\\n2014 - Mana Art Basel, Miami, Florida\\r\\n2013 - Symposium Sculpture New Art Arcaelogy, Boston, Massachusetts\\r\\n2013 - Symposium Sculpture, Nashua New Hampshire\\r\\n2006 - Davidoff of Geneva.

He stood out as a human rights activist and also in the constitution of the Argentine Youth Political Coordination (Coordinadora de Juventudes Pol�ticas Argentinas) between 1970 and 1980.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildhood and youth\\r\\nNadra was born in Buenos Aires on April 12 of 1952, the youngest of the three children of Fernando Nadra and Zulma Beltramone. However, his family was able to sign him in the local civil registry on April 15, due to complications associated to political pursuits and his father\\'s imprisonment.\\r\\nHe made his elementary studies in different schools of Buenos Aires, sometimes with false identities and documents. This period of his life was determining for his posterior social and political commitment, and he has named it as \"The lost childhood\" (\"La infancia extraviada\") in his books Secrets in Red (Secretos en Rojo).\\r\\nNadra made his first year of high school in an institution situated in Haedo, Buenos Aires, but after completing the academic year, the authorities forced him to abandon the place due to his student activism. He finished his studies in the baccalaureate of National School Mariano Moreno and later he began to study Sociology and Law in the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), but he did not complete any of the two careers.\\r\\nOn March 26 of 1982 he married Leonor Canelles, the eldest daughter of the leader of the trade-union of construction, Jorge Canelles, one of the primary promoters of the popular rebellion called the Cordobazo, along with the Secretary of the Trade-union \"Luz y Fuerza\", Agust�n Tosco.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudent militancy\\r\\nIn 1965 he was chosen by his classmates as a student delegate in a high school of commercial orientation situated in Haedo, Buenos Aires. During that period he took part in a wall newspaper, in which the invasion that 42.000 American marines had made in Dominic Republic to prevent the reinstatement of the legitimate government of Juan Bosch was reported and condemned. As a result of the manifestation, the authorities expelled him from the school. After his classmates� mobilization, Nadra was reincorporated, but the school directors imposed a disciplinary sanction and asked him to change of establishment the following year.\\r\\nIn 1966 Nadra entered to the Mariano Moreno National School, where he collaborated in the reorganization of the Student Center between 1966 and 1967, meanwhile the dictatorship of Juan Carlos Ongan�a prohibited any type of student activism. In 1968, Nadra was one of the delegates that promoted the first high school strike, against the imposition of curriculums considered by the students as anti-pedagogical and restrictive. \\r\\nIn 1969 his school\\'s Student Center repudiated the assassinations of students in popular manifestations in some Argentine provinces, like Corrientes, Rosario and C�rdoba. The students began to use black badges in their jackets and dusts covers. This measure was generalized in several public establishments of the country.\\r\\nDuring his years as a college student, Nadra was member of the Delegate Council and the Student Center of the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature of the Buenos Aires University. He also participated in the occupation of establishments and in some confrontations with the local police and the Guard of Infantry, as a part of the national movement against the admission exams in 1970 and 1971. Many times, Nadra was imprisoned and illegally deprived of his freedom by the police and para-police groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical Militancy\\r\\nNadra began his political activity as a member of the Federaci�n Juvenil Comunista. He was involved in its student\\'s organisms and in its press union. In 1970 and 1982 he was elected to be a member of the Political Relations Commission and of the Central Committee of that organization. Nadra also directed the biweekly \"Aqu� y Ahora\" during a period of the military dictatorship and until 1984, when he began to collaborate in the direction of the Communist Party of Argentina.\\r\\nIn this period he was part of the Editorial Council of the magazine Nueva Era and he directed the seminary Propuesta (with a distribution of 150,000 copies). He also participated in the redactions of the documents Tesis and Informe Central, the theoretical axes of the so-called \"turn\" process, in the XVI Congress of the organization, in November 1986. In spite of having been elected as member of the Central Committee in that ceremony, the denaturalization of the \"turn\" made more evident the differences between Nadra and the hegemonic sector of the Direction. As a result, he gave up the PC on October 8 of 1990, after 26 years of militancy activity.\\r\\nIn the first years of the decade of 1970, Nadra was one of the founders of Political Youth of Argentina and he collaborated in his reconstruction, between the military coup and 1982. That same year, the JPA were relaunched as Movement of Political Youth.\\r\\nGenerally omitted in the testimonial and academic works about the resistance to the National Reorganization Progress (Proceso de Reorganizacion Nacional), the action of the JPA �with the common efforts of young peronists, communists, radical, intransigent, Christian democrats and socialists, among others- motorized the reappearance of the juvenile action in the labor and student movement, the agricultural youth and the cultural spaces of actors, plastic artists and writers. \\r\\nAmong his most important initiatives we can find the call for peace in the Beagle Conflict, the mobilization for the visit of de Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in 1979, the march of the Commission of the 25 and of the CGT Brazil to the San Cayetano church, and on March 30 of 1982, the Day of debate and mobilization in the surrounding area of Plaza de Mayo.\\r\\nIn parallel with his cooperation works with other political organizations, Nadra was involved in strong controversies. Many of them from his biweekly column \"Temas de Debate\" (Topics on Debate), in the newspaper Aqu� y Ahora. In 1997, stands out his rough reply to the article of Juan Gelman in P�gina/12, although the newspaper published it partially.\\r\\nMore recently, Nadra replied to the critics of Manuel Gaggero to the communists, in an article about the assault of the People\\'s Revolutionary Army to the Monte Chingolo\\'s headquarters.\\r\\nIn December 1997 he integrated the Confluence Forum, with a hundred of political, social and artistic personalities that claimed strong changes to the programmatic document \"Carta a los Argentinos\" (approved for the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education in 1998, as an electoral platform) y questioned the election of Fernando de la R�a as a presidential candidate in 1999.\\r\\nHe was part of the UNITE party, and, as a part of his direction, he accorded with N�stor Kirchner  a programmatical approach to support his candidature at the end of 2002, afterwards led by the Front for Victory.\\r\\nBetween 2004 and December 2015 he was delegated of Sedronar in the National Congress.\\r\\n\\r\\nHuman Rights\\r\\nAcross his militancy in the JPA, Nadra was intimately committed with APDH, LADH, the relatives of missing and imprisoned by political reasons, the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo and the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. In 1977 he participated, along with other youthful leaders to the first march of the Mothers of Plaza de Mayo and he was also one of the organizers of the youth seminars of the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights in 1979 and 1980.\\r\\nBetween September 6 and 20 of 1979, Nadra integrated the youthful delegation that made the speech in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, CIDH.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlan C�ndor\\r\\nRecently it was revealed that Nadra was an important part of the network of counterintelligence and solidarity that saved lives, denounced atrocities and even promoted actions during the so-called Operation Condor. This plan of the dictatorships of the Latin American South Cone was based on the extermination of the left-wing movement and the revolutionary nationalism, with the logistic help and under the direction of the CIA.\\r\\nThe network in which Nadra took part, connected the graphic and radio media from Moscow, Prague and Berlin, as well as others from Occidental Europe, with the activities that were being done inside the affected countries and had the logistic and intelligence support of the communist parties of the continent and the \"Social Field\", as it was called in that time. \\r\\nOther links in this informative and logistic network were the journalists and communist militants Isidoro Gilbert, Arturo Lozza, Rodolfo Nadra y Adolfo Coronato (de la Argentina), Jos� Miguel Varas, Luis C�rdova, Enrique Martini and Jos� Maldavsky (from Chile), Elvio Romero (from Paraguay); Niko Scwartz and Ricardo Saxlund (from Uruguay), among others.\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalistic work\\r\\nAlberto Nadra began his work as a journalist in the weekly publication Prop�sitos, created by Le�nidas Barletta. After that, Nadra was correspondent for local and foreign media, and he also worked as chief of redaction and directed several newspapers. His press investigations took him to Rome, Moscow, Habana, Algeria, Paris, Prague, Samarkanda, Irkutsk. Between 1973 and 1989 he visited Chile, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay.\\r\\nIn 1973 he participated in an operation of rescue and diffusion of the last poem of V�ctor Jara, written little before his murder in the National Stadium of Santiago de Chile, after the military coup led by Augusto Pinochet. His commitment with the denunciations of the violations of human rights in Argentina continued while he was working as chief of redaction and editor of the South Cone area reporting from Buenos Aires for the Prensa Latina (PL-Cuba) Agency, between 1976 and 1983.\\r\\nIn 1977 Nadra received and published one copy of the letter that Rodolfo Walsh sent to the military junta, just before his kidnap and disappearance. From that moment on, PL was the first agency which spread the document in all the world media, even before it was known in Argentina. \\r\\nNadra was threatened with death and in some partially declassified documents from the CIA he appears as \"agent of intelligence\" \". In 1979, the Journalists International Organization distinguished his work with the Journalist Merit Award.\\r\\nIn the press syndicalism area, Nadra took part in the Electoral Meeting of the Association Journalists of Buenos Aires (known as APBA in that moment, and then UTPBA), for the elections of July 27 to July 31 of 1972. In those elections participated Jorge Luis Bernetti, Carlos Borro, Mar�a Victoria \"Vicky\" Walsh, Eduardo Molina, Vedia, Mar�a Cristina Su�rez (Brown List); y Sergio Peralta, Enrique Tortosa, Julio Orione, Walter Fumarola, Ricardo Mainardi, Jorge Marrone (Blue and White List). In 1975 the union was intervened by Isabel Per�n government. This situation continued during the following military government.\\r\\nIn 1983, some days after the democratic recovery, Nadra travelled to Moscow as delegate of the Youthful Communist Federation to make a speech in the International Journalists Congress in Moscow.\\r\\nBetween 1995 and 1999 he was producer and host of the TV show \"Pol�tica en Acci�n\", that was broadcast by the Politics and Economic Channel, of the cable TV operator Cablevision.\\r\\nIn 2004 he cofounded \"Los 100\" (The hundred), collective of journalists and communication workers that encouraged the Audiovisual Communication Services Law. Currently, Alberto Nadra works as organization secretary.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeaching\\r\\nDuring his Sociology and Law studies, he worked as assistant professor in the classes of Carlos Santiago Nino and Enrique Bacigalupo. However, after this period, Nadra moved away of the academic life in order to concentrate his efforts in the political activity. \\r\\nBetween 1982 and 1987 he taught journalism and discourse analysis in the Foundation of Economic and Social Studies (Fundaci�n de Estudios Econ�micos y Sociales) in Argentina, Chile and Bolivia. A few years later he taught Informative Analysis in the Institute of Specialized Journalism (IPE), located in Mercedes, Buenos Aires province. In 1999 he was the director of the course \"Ethics, Journalism and Society\", in the University of Palermo (Buenos Aires).\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards and Distinctions\\r\\nAward for \"Professional Merit\" of the Journalists International Organization, 1979, for his work on human rights in Argentina.\\r\\nAward H�ctor Oesterheld 2003, for his journalistic work.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublished books\\r\\nSECRETOS EN ROJO.

He\\'s known as the founder of Spatialism and exponent of abstract painting as the first known artist to slash his canvases - which symbolizes an utter rejection of all prerequisites of art.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nBorn in Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina, to Italian immigrant parents, he was the son of the sculptor Luigi Fontana (1865–1946). Fontana spent the first years of his life in Argentina and then was sent to Italy in 1905, where he stayed until 1922, working as a sculptor with his father, and then on his own. Already in 1926, he participated in the first exhibition of Nexus, a group of young Argentine artists working in Rosario de Santa Fé.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nIn 1927 Fontana returned to Italy and studied alongside Fausto Melotti under the sculptor Adolfo Wildt, at Accademia di Brera from 1928 to 1930. It was there he presented his first exhibition in 1930, organized by the Milan art gallery Il Milione. During the following decade he journeyed in Italy and France, working with abstract and expressionist painters. In 1935 he joined the association Abstraction-Création in Paris and from 1936 to 1949 made expressionist sculptures in ceramic and bronze. In 1939, he joined the Corrente, a Milan group of expressionist artists.\\r\\nIn 1940 he returned to Argentina. In Buenos Aires (1946) he founded the Altamira academy together with some of his students, and made public the White Manifesto, which states: \"Matter, colour and sound in motion are the phenomena whose simultaneous development makes up the new art\". In the text, which Fontana did not sign but to which he actively contributed, he began to formulate the theories that he was to expand as Spazialismo, or Spatialism, in five manifestos from 1947 to 1952. Upon his return from Argentina in 1947, he supported, along with writers and philosophers, the first manifesto of spatialism (Spazialismo)**. Fontana\\'s studio and works were completely destroyed in the Allied bombings of Milan, but he soon resumed his ceramics works in Albisola. In Milan, he collaborated with noted Milanese architects to decorate several new buildings that were part of the effort to reconstruct the city after the war.\\r\\nFollowing his return to Italy in 1948 Fontana exhibited his first Ambiente spaziale a luce nera (\\'Spatial environment\\') (1949) at the Galleria del Naviglio in Milan, a temporary installation consisting of a giant amoeba-like shape suspended in the void in a darkened room and lit by neon light. From 1949 on he started the so-called Spatial Concept or slash series, consisting in holes or slashes on the surface of monochrome paintings, drawing a sign of what he named \"an art for the Space Age\". He devised the generic title Concetto spaziale (\\'spatial concept\\') for these works and used it for almost all his later paintings. These can be divided into broad categories: the Buchi (\\'holes), beginning in 1949, and the Tagli (\\'slashes\\'), which he instituted in the mid-1950s.\\r\\n\\r\\nFontana often lined the reverse of his canvases with black gauze so that the darkness would shimmer behind the open cuts and create a mysterious sense of illusion and depth. He then created an elaborate neon ceiling called \"Luce spaziale\" in 1951 for the Triennale in Milan. In his important series of Concetto spaziale, La Fine di Dio (1963–64), Fontana uses the egg shape. With his Pietre (stones) series, begun in 1952, Fontana fused the sculptural with painting by encrusting the surfaces of his canvases with heavy impasto and colored glass. In his Buchi (holes) cycle, begun in 1949–50, he punctured the surface of his canvases, breaking the membrane of two-dimensionality in order to highlight the space behind the picture. From 1958 he purified his paintings by creating matte, monochrome surfaces, thus focusing the viewer\\'s attention on the slices that rend the skin of the canvas. In 1959 Fontana exhibited cut-off paintings with multiple combinable elements (he named the sets quanta), and began Nature, a series of sculptures made by cutting a gash across a sphere of terracotta clay, which he subsequently cast in bronze.\\r\\nFontana engaged in many collaborative projects with important architects of the day, particularly Luciano Baldessari, who shared and supported his research for Spatial Light – Structure in Neon (1951) at the 9th Triennale and, among other things, commissioned him to design the ceiling of the cinema in the Sidercomit Pavilion at the 21st Milan Fair in 1953.\\r\\nAround 1960, Fontana began to reinvent the cuts and punctures that had characterized his highly personal style up to that point, covering canvases with layers of thick oil paint applied by hand and brush and using a scalpel or utility knife to create great fissures in their surface. In 1961, following an invitation to participate along with artists Jean Dubuffet, Mark Rothko, Sam Francis, and others in an exhibition of contemporary painting entitled \"Art and Contemplation\", held at Palazzo Grassi in Venice, he created a series of 22 works dedicated to the lagoon city. He manipulated the paint with his fingers and various instruments to make furrows, sometimes including scattered fragments of Murano glass. Fontana was subsequently invited by Michel Tapié to exhibit the works at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York. As a consequence of his first visit to New York in 1961, he created a series of metal works, done between 1961 and 1965. The works consisted of large sheets of shiny and scratched copper, pierced and gouged, cut through by dramatic vertical gestures that recall the force of New York construction and the metal and glass of the buildings.\\r\\nAmong Fontana\\'s last works are a series of Teatrini (‘little theatres’), in which he returned to an essentially flat idiom by using backcloths enclosed within wings resembling a frame; the reference to theatre emphasizes the act of looking, while in the foreground a series of irregular spheres or oscillating, wavy silhouettes creates a lively shadow play. Another work from that time, Trinità (Trinity) (1966), consists of three large white canvases punctuated by lines of holes, embraced in a theatrical setting made from ultramarine plastic sheets vaguely resembling wings.\\r\\nIn the last years of his career, Fontana became increasingly interested in the staging of his work in the many exhibitions that honored him worldwide, as well as in the idea of purity achieved in his last white canvases. These concerns were prominent at the 1966 Venice Biennale, for which he designed the environment for his work. At Documenta IV in Kassel in 1968, he positioned a large, plaster slash as the centre of a totally white labyrinth, including ceiling and floor (Ambiente spaziale bianco).\\r\\nShortly before his death he was present at the \"Destruction Art, Destroy to Create\" demonstration at the Finch College Museum of New York. Then he left his home in Milano and went to Comabbio (in the province of Varese, Italy), his family\\'s mother town, where he died in 1968.\\r\\nFontana created a prolific amount of graphic work with abstract motifs as well as figures, little-known in the art world, at the same time as he was producing his abstract perforated works. He was also the sculptor of the bust of Ovidio Lagos, founder of the La Capital newspaper, in Carrara marble.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\nFontana had his first solo exhibitions at Galleria del Milione, Milan, in 1931. In 1961, Michel Tapié organized his first show in the U.S., an exhibition of the Venice series, at the Martha Jackson Gallery, New York. His first solo exhibition at an American museum was held at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, in 1966. He participated in the Bienal de São Paulo and in numerous exhibitions around the world. Among others, major retrospectives have been organized by the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice (2006), Hayward Gallery, London (1999), Fondazione Lucio Fontana (1999), and the Centre Pompidou (1987; traveled to La Fundación \\'la Caixa\\' Barcelona; Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam; Whitechapel Gallery, London). Since 1930 Fontana\\'s work had been exhibited regularly at the Venice Biennale, and he represented Argentina various times; he was awarded the Grand Prize for Painting at the Venice Biennale of 1966. In 2014, the Musée d\\'Art moderne de Paris dedicates a retrospective to the artist. Tornabuoni art held a parallel show in its Avenue Matignon Paris gallery space. The first major American retrospective since the artist\\'s death came in 2019 at the Met Breuer.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollections\\r\\nFontana\\'s works can be found in the permanent collections of more than one hundred museums around the world. In particular, examples from the Pietre series are housed in the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, the Centre Pompidou, Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Galleria Nazionale d\\'Arte Moderna in Rome, the Museum of Contemporary Art Villa Croce in Genoa and the van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. Fontana\\'s jewelry is included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt market\\r\\nItalian scholar Enrico Crispolti edited a two-volume catalogue raisonné of Fontana\\'s paintings, sculptures and environments in 2006. In 2013, Luca Massimo Barbero, Nina Ardemagni Laurini and Silvia Ardemagni published a three-volume catalogue raisonné of Fontana\\'s works on paper, including more than 5,500 works in chronological order.\\r\\nA rare, large crimson work with a single slash, which Fontana dedicated to his wife and which has always been known as the Teresita, fetched £6.7 million ($11.6 million) at Christie\\'s London in 2008, then an auction record for the artist. Fontana\\'s Concetto Spaziale, Attese (1965), from the collection of Anna-Stina Malmborg Hoglund and Gunnar Hoglund set a new record for a slash painting at £8.4 million at Sotheby\\'s London in 2015. Even more popular are Fontana\\'s oval canvases. Sotheby\\'s sold a work titled Concetto spaziale, la fine di dio (1963) for £10.32 million in 2008. Part of Fontana\\'s Venice circle, Festival on the Grand Canal was sold at Christie\\'s in New York for $7 million in 2008.\\r\\nIn November 2015, Christie\\'s set an auction record for the artist\\'s work Concetto spaziale, la fine di dio, 1964, sold for $29 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nGottschaller, Pia, 2012.

June 9] 1883 – December 20, 1958) was a Soviet and Russian socialist realist writer, best known for his 1925 novel Cement. Gladkov joined a Marxist group in 1904, and in 1905 went to Tiflis (now Tbilisi) and was arrested there for revolutionary activities. He was sentenced to three years\\' exile. He then moved to Novorossiysk. Among other positions, he served as the editor of the newspaper Krasnoye Chernomorye, secretary of the journal Novy Mir, special correspondent for Izvestia, and director of the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow from 1945 to 1948. He received the Stalin Prize (in 1949) for his literary accomplishments, and is considered a classic writer of Soviet Socialist Realist literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeacher, exile and revolutionary\\r\\nGladkov was born in 1883 in Bolshaya Chernavka, Saratov Governorate (present-day Penza Oblast) to a family of Old Believers. In 1904, Gladkov began propaganda work for the Social Revolutionary Party in Chita, Irkutsk, joining the teachers\\' institute of Tiflis in the following year. In 1906 he began propaganda work for the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and was exiled that November for four years to Manzurka village in Irkutsk province. After completing his exile, Gladkov returned to Novorossiisk and to the Kuban where he was appointed the head of a primary school in Pavlovskaya.\\r\\nIn the spring of 1918 he returned to Novorossiisk to reorganise schools after the revolution in October 1917, though was forced into hiding when the Whites (pro-monarchist forces) captured the village in August of that year. In 1920, by which time the Whites had been driven out, Gladkov was appointed as the head of education in the town. He would also serve in the Red Army, before being made editor of the newspaper Krasnoye chernomorye. In 1921 he moved to Moscow where he was appointed as the head of a factory school, then secretary of the journal Novy mir (New World). Gladkov was a member of The Smithy writers group, which was engaged in polemics with the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP). While a proponent of portraying the revolution in literature, he was anxious about the tone in which groups such as RAPP and MAPP (Moscow Association of Proletarian Writers) conducted their discussions, and the \"working over\" that non-RAPP writers were given in particular journals.  In 1921 \"as an intellectual and a Menshevik\" he was expelled from the Communist Party but was then reinstated after the publication of Cement.\\r\\nIn 1941 he became a special correspondent for the newspaper Izvestia and Pravda, reporting from Sverdlovsk, specialising in war-time industrial topics.

For 17 years (1957–1974), he was editor-in-chief of the Cairo newspaper Al-Ahram and was a commentator on Arab affairs for more than 50 years.\\r\\nHeikal articulated the thoughts of President Gamal Abdel Nasser earlier in his career. He worked as a ghostwriter for the Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and represented the ideology of pan-Arabism. Heikal was a member of the Central Committee of the Arab Socialist Union. He was appointed minister of information in April 1970 but resigned from government in 1974 over differences with Anwar Sadat.\\r\\nIn September 2003, upon reaching the age of 80, Heikal wrote an article in the monthly magazine Weghat Nazar (where he had been writing for some time) that the time had come for an \"old warrior\" to put down his pen and take to the sidelines. Heikal stressed that his decision to stop writing did not mean he would disappear, but rather take to the sidelines to observe more thoroughly. In the article he also recounted a lot of the events that occurred during his life and formed his experience including his first mission as a reporter in the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942, his friendship with Nasser and his relationship with Sadat. In addition he opened his financial records stating the salaries he had received in all his jobs and posts.\\r\\nIn a 2007 audience with British journalist Robert Fisk, Heikal spoke about the situation in Egypt and criticized Egyptian president Mubarak, saying that Mubarak lives in a \"world of fantasy\" in Sharm al Sheikh. These comments stirred an uproar within Egyptian society, both for and against Heikal. Heikal did not comment on this criticism except later on Al Jazeera, where he said that he stands by what he has said earlier, adding that Mubarak had not entered political life until very late, which means he lacks necessary experience.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nBorn in Cairo, Egypt, he counted Abdel Nasser among his grandparents. His family were wealthy wheat merchants in the Nile delta. Mohamed the eldest son in his family, which included three other sisters, was trained to manage the business. However he sought a valuable degree course education at the respected American University in Cairo. During the Second World War, the graduate Heikal commenced a career in journalism at the British controlled and funded Egyptian Gazette, which he edited from 1943.  The newspaper\\'s contributors included English writers George Orwell and Lawrence Durrell. Throughout his career he was a literary critic of Anwar Sadat and Hosni Mubarak\\'s military regimes, which he perceived as having departed from Nasser\\'s original nationalist dream.\\r\\nBut this attitude was most dramatic during wartime. He covered the First Arab-Israeli War on the establishment of the State of Israel. He was also present in Cairo when the Free Officers staged a military coup d\\'etat in 1952. During this period he immediately befriended with Gamal Abdel Nasser, a member of the group. Yet his journalism with Al-Ahram as its editor put the regimes under the microscope, gaining a reputation for investigative reporting, and sound authoritative statements. The Washington Post dubbed him \"the voice of Egypt...window on a secretive regime\". Heikal frequently travelled cross-desert borders between countries in the Middle East eagerly reporting on the conflicts. Heikal was an unashamed Pro-Arabist during the post-war era when Nasser dreamed of a Pan-Arab republic across the whole region. Between 1957 and 1974 he was the author of a well-regarded Friday column Bi-Saraha which spoke frankly about Nasser\\'s policies at home and abroad, whilst also being critical. He became a member of the Arab Socialist Union Party, briefly acting as foreign minister under Nasser. But his mood changed with the Colonel\\'s successors, whose lurch to the right shook Cairo\\'s post-colonial establishment.\\r\\nIn April 1970 Heikal was appointed minister of information, replacing Mohamed Fayek in the post. After decades of tension and conflict, Sadat\\'s decision in the 1970s was momentous: recognition of the Israeli right to occupy Jerusalem, and to the border with Sinai terminating with Port Eilat. The Egyptians and the Israelis agreed to these terms yearning for peace at almost any price. Sadat, a moderate himself, prepared to meet the implacable Cold War enemy for a negotiated settlement. Heikal was among the old Nasserite Cairo elites that opposed any suggestion of a diplomatic rapprochement with the hated enemy. In 1974 he was removed from post by Sadat\\'s office and jailed for treasonous activity. Sadat\\'s assassination was a setback for Arab-Israeli relations, and ushered a period of retrenched reaction to threats posed by military situations to the stability of Egypt, events explored in Heikal\\'s book Autumn of Fury (1982). President Mubarak was more conscious of security, policing and law and order, imposing crackdowns on protests. Abroad Egypt, he continued Sadat\\'s realignment with the West, and particularly American global capitalism that funded the permanence of the Israeli State, Mubarak\\'s new political realism prompted Heikal\\'s move to a fundamentalist opposition to what he interpreted as a return to colonial status quo ante. Joining Al-Jazeera Television in Qatar, Heikal was able to comment on the Gulf War and then ensuing conflicts from a purely Islamic perspective.  In 1996 he published an influential publication Secret Channels in which he told the chronological story leading up to the culmination of the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993 orchestrated by the West to bring an end to decades of war in Palestine. By the end of his period at Al-Jazeera, he attacked Mubarak in his book Mubarak and His Time calling him \"inept and corrupt\". Nonetheless, the advent of a new extremist dawn with the Muslim Brotherhood forced Heikal to awake to the perils of chaos. The compromise position of a US-educated president and more social freedoms in Egypt made Sisi more acceptable to Heikal\\'s nationalistic views. Heikal suffered from kidney disease in his final years, and died aged 92 from renal failure.\\r\\n\\r\\nAl Jazeera Lecture Series\\r\\nHeikal\\'s lecture series on Al Jazeera furnished him with a greater platform in the Arab world, broadcasting every Thursday evening.  Here he generally discussed information he acquired during his years as a journalist, historian, and a player in the political arena in Egypt\\'s modern history.  His lectures gave an overview of the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of modern Arab nationalist governments. He also lectured on the rise of the American Empire and the decline of the previous superpowers. His lectures ranged from general overviews to intricate details of scenes he witnessed. In addition he discussed the events leading to the deterioration of Nasser\\'s relationship with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood and the failed assassination attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\n2007 Al Jazeera Lecture Series\\r\\nChallenges in Building the Aswan Dam\\r\\nAswan Dam and the National Project\\r\\nThe United States and the Arab/Israeli Conflict\\r\\nSlipping into War\\r\\nPalestinians and Prospects of Settlement with Israel\\r\\nIsraeli Thinking and the 1956 Events\\r\\nConspiracy and Coup Era\\r\\nFrench Plans to Interfere in Egypt\\r\\nCreative Chaos and the Rivalry Links\\r\\nConspiracy Theory\\r\\nNasser\\'s Debates with the West\\r\\nProspects of Settlement in the Middle East (2)\\r\\nProspects of Settlement in the Middle East (1)\\r\\nNasser\\'s Ultimate Test\\r\\nJordan\\'s 1956 Storm\\r\\nBehind the Arms Deal\\r\\nSecurity and National Peace\\r\\nArms Deals in the Arab World\\r\\nGeneva Convention and the Importance of 1955\\r\\nBandong Convention\\r\\nPreparing for Plan Alpha\\r\\nIsraeli Penetration in the Region\\r\\nNasser\\'s Meeting with UK\\'s Foreign Secretary\\r\\n1955 and the Arab Division\\r\\n1955 and the Distinguishing Symbols\\r\\n\\r\\n2008 Al Jazeera Lecture Series\\r\\nMine in the Aqaba Gulf\\r\\nIsrael\\'s Nuclear Weapons\\r\\nPolitics and History\\r\\nWorld on the Verge of Chaos\\r\\nWorld Foreign and Internal Politics\\r\\nUnderstanding of War in Nations\\r\\nArab Resistance and Aid\\r\\nWar Era: Strategy and Politics\\r\\nArab False Battles\\r\\nInstance of True Revolution\\r\\nAmerica Leads the World\\r\\nPalestine: Right Refuses to be Forgotten (2)\\r\\nPalestine: Right Refuses to be Forgotten (1)\\r\\nIsrael\\'s View on Egyptian Role in the Region\\r\\nSeries of Crises in the Time of War\\r\\nThe Naked Empire\\r\\nAlliance of Empires\\r\\nMonsters With Eight Heads\\r\\nEgyptian Armament and Israel\\'s Security\\r\\nDecision Projects Associated with Suez\\r\\nSuez War\\r\\nConspiracy Theory\\r\\nNational Security Boundaries\\r\\nProtecting Suez Canal\\r\\nSeven Plans to Invade\\r\\nSuez Battle and War Era\\r\\nTruth of Wars the Arabs Fought\\r\\nNational Security Theories\\r\\nArriving Tremors\\r\\nWar Era\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterary works\\r\\n(1973) The Cairo Documents: The Inside Story of Nasser and His Relationship with World Leaders, Rebels, and Statesmen (New York: Doubleday, 1973), ISBN 9780385064477\\r\\n(1975) The Road to Ramadan (New York: Quadrangle/New York Times Book Co., 1975), ISBN 9780812905670\\r\\n(1978) Sphinx and Commissar: The rise and fall of Soviet influence in the Arab world (London: Collins, 1978), ISBN 9780002167871\\r\\n(1980) October War (Crown, 1980), ISBN 9780394595962\\r\\n(1981) The Return of the Ayatollah: The Iranian Revolution from Mossadeq to Khomeini (London: Deutsch, 1981) ISBN 9780233974040\\r\\n(1982) Iran: The Untold Story (Pantheon Books, 1982), ISBN 9780394522753\\r\\n(1983) Autumn of Fury: The Assassination of Sadat (London: Deutsch, 1983 & London: Corgi, 1984), ISBN 9780552990981, in which he analyzed the reasons behind Sadat’s assassination and the rise of political Islam.\\r\\n(1986) Cutting the Lion\\'s Tale: Suez Through Egyptian Eyes (London: A.

He is known as one of the most important figures in the cultural, political, and social life of Costa Rica during the latter half of the twentieth century. The National Library System of Costa Rica credits Cañas with more than 4,773 publications as of 2005.\\r\\nHe was Vice Minister of International Relations (1955–1956), ambassador (1956–1958), and a two-time deputy (1962–1966 and 1994–1998). Additionally, he was the first Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports (1970). He edited several newspapers: Diario de Costa Rica (Costa Rica Daily), La República (The Republic), and Excelsior (Excelsior). He wrote editorials for La Nación (The Nation), La Prensa Libre (The Free Press), and Semanario Universidad (University Weekly). Cañas is the great-grandson of General José María Cañas Escamilla.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nCañas was born in San José. His sister taught him to read at the age of three. He attended elementary school at the Edificio Metálico (Metal Building), a San José landmark. Cañas attended secondary school at Liceo de Costa Rica (Costa Rica Lyceum), where he graduated in 1937. He attended the University of Costa Rica, studying law and graduating as an attorney in 1944. His thesis involved the nature of political parties. Studying at the same time as Cañas were other national politicians including Rodrigo Facio, Carlos Monge, Gonzalo Facio, Jorge Rossi Chavarría, Daniel Oduber, and Hernán González. After the Costa Rican Civil War, this group of intellectuals would change the nature of Costa Rican politics.\\r\\nIn 1944, Cañas began working for Diario de Costa Rica (Costa Rica Daily), San José-based newspaper. Because he was concerned largely with social questions, Cañas joined the Center for the Study of National Problems. In the 1946, Cañas wrote \"Elegía Inmóvil\" (\"Unmoving Elegy\"), a book-length poem that brought him international attention, although he would shortly thereafter abandon poetry to focus on politics and letters.\\r\\nIn 1950, he founded and edited La República (The Republic), another Costa Rican newspaper. He later founded and edited Excelsior. He also wrote \"Una Casa en el Barrio Carmen\" (\"A House in the Carmen Neighborhood\") in 1965, a book for which he received considerable praise. It was reprinted at least four times.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical life\\r\\nCañas became the Costa Rican ambassador to the United Nations in 1948 and 1949. He contributed to the writing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. He was Vice Minister of International Relations from 1955 to 1956 and a San José deputy for the National Liberation Party from 1962 until 1966. From 1970 to 1974, Cañas served as Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports. During his time there, he encouraged the development of cultural and literary values among Costa Ricans. He was President of the Legislative Assembly 1994–1995. Cañas helped found the Citizens\\' Action Party (PAC for its Spanish initials) in 2002 along with members of the two leading political parties of the country. He served as president of PAC\\'s Political Commission.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcademic life\\r\\nIn 1971, Cañas founded the National Theater Company. Among his duties, he was a theatrical teacher, promoter, and creator. He worked in the College of Science and Letters at UCR.\\r\\nAdditionally, he served as President of the Journalists Association in 1952, President of Editorial Costa Rica since 1960, President of the Writers Association from 1960 to 1961, and board member of the governing Social Security organization in 1989, among other responsibilities. Since 1967, Cañas has served as a chairperson of the Language Academy of Costa Rica, a position which has since been made permanent.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater years\\r\\nCañas was a permanent member of the Costa Rican Academy of Language. Additionally, he hosted \"Así es la cosa\" (\"Here\\'s the Thing\") on Radio Monumental, alongside Fernando Durán and Álvaro Fernández. Cañas also wrote \"Chisporroteos\" (Crackles), a newspaper column for more than forty years which made him one of Costa Rica\\'s most prolific authors. He was also a professor at the University of Costa Rica in the school of Social Sciences.\\r\\nOn 14 June 2014, Cañas died of complications after intestinal surgery. He was 94.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards\\r\\nIn 1965, Cañas won the \"Premio Aquileo Echeverría de Cuento\" (\"Aquileo Echeverría Story Prize\") for his work book \"Una Casa en el Barrio Carmen.\" In 1976, he won the Magón National Prize for Culture. In 1964, he won the Premio García Monge (García Monge Prize) for the promotion of culture. Cañas has won numerous other awards. He received an honorary degree from the State Correspondence University and the commendation of \"Comendador de la Orden de Liberación de España\" (Commander of the Order of Spanish Liberation) in 1951, membership in the Order of Vasco Núñez de Balboa in 1957, and the Ordine della Stella della Solidarietà Italiana (Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity) in 1959.

He has resided in Moscow since 1978.\\r\\nA supporter of Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s reforms, Gelman was elected to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1989 and to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union upon Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s recommendation in 1990, before leaving the Communist Party of the Soviet Union less than a year later.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nEarly years\\r\\nShunya (later renamed Alexander) Gelman was born in Donduşeni (now in Moldova), a Bessarabian village that had been part of the Russian Empire before it was returned to Romania during the Russian Civil War and Soviet annexation in 1940. His parents were Isaak Davydovich Gelman (1904—1981) and Manya Shayevna Gelman (1910—1942). After the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, the occupying German forces deported the Gelman family to the Bershad ghetto in Transnistria, where his mother died. Only Alexander Gelman and his father (from 14 deported members) survived a death march upon leaving the camp near the end of the war.\\r\\nGelman graduated from a vocational school in Chernovtsy, Ukrainian SSR in 1951 and attended a naval school in Lvov (Lviv) in 1952–1954 and became an officer in the Soviet Navy, serving between 1954 and 1960 in the Black Sea Fleet\\'s coastal defense and on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Soviet Far East. He also worked in factories and in construction.\\r\\nIn 1966 he moved to Leningrad, where he worked as a journalist for the municipal newspapers Smena (The Work Shift) and Stroitelny Rabochy (Construction Worker). During this period he started learning and working on screenwriting.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheatrical and movie career\\r\\nIn 1970 he co-authored a screenplay (with his future wife Tatyana Pavlovna Kaletskaya). It was later filmed as Night Shift. The next screenplay, also together with Tatiana, led to the movie Xenia, Wife of Fyodor (Lenfilm, 1974), which won an award in a USSR-wide competition.\\r\\nHis career reached an early peak with the 1974 play Protokol odnogo zasedaniya (Minutes of a Meeting, also translated as A Party Committee Meeting) and staged in Leningrad at the Gorky Bolshoi Drama Theater by Georgy Tovstonogov and a year later at the Moscow Art Theatre by Oleg Yefremov; it was filmed in 1975 as Premiya (Salary Bonus). It depicted a construction crew\\'s rejection of a salary bonus on the grounds that they felt cheated by bad management and poor workplace organization. Acclaimed as a sociological drama, the film won director Sergey Mikaelyan and screenwriter Gelman the USSR State Prize in 1976. Many people called Protokol odnogo zasedaniya prophetic, \"presaging the strikes of summer 1980 and the workers\\' movement in Poland.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOther plays are Obratnaya svyaz\\' [Feedback] (1976), My, nizhepodpisavshiesya [We, the undersigned] (1979), Skameika [The bench] (1983), Zinulya (1984), and Poslednee budushchee [The most recent future] (2010). Boris Kagarlitsky writes of his plays (through the late 1980s):\\r\\nGel\\'man is free from naïve technocratic illusions; he knows economic reality other than by hearsay.... Real people appear on the stage. Instead of Shatrov\\'s faceless technocrats we see live production-workers who turn out to be very different, unlike each other, complex, unexpected.... Gel\\'man\\'s most recent plays ... localize the conflict, so to speak – confine it to a small group of people. More and more attention is paid to the conduct of particular individuals. ... There are no workers here. This is the world of lower and middle-ranking \\'chiefs\\'. Bureaucracy. A milieu in which honesty is impossible, unattainable, having been eradicated. Love for one\\'s job and confidence in one\\'s rightness are also unattainable.... We behold the anatomy of the bureaucratic world, its mechanisms, the Mafia-like bonds among the bureaucratic cliques, the formation of a \\'clientage\\', and all the relationships that result.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical career\\r\\nElected to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1989, Gelman was an outspoken supporter of liberal changes and of general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev\\'s perestroika and glasnost package in the 1980s, but in a 1989 interview with David Remnick of The Washington Post\\'\\' characterized the idea of the liberal politician Boris Yeltsin taking the place of Gorbachev was \"a bit ridiculous\". Supporting Gorbachev\\'s new course against its critics, Gelman opined that \"If the processes of democratization are halted, if perestroika is thrown out, a moral death awaits our party, the party of Lenin.\"\\r\\nIn 1990, Gorbachev personally recommended Gelman to become a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, but left the party months afterward without stepping down from the Committee, prompting his fellow members to take the step of expelling him from the Central Committee afterward.

At different times Bennis also worked as a grocer, a librarian and a newspaper editor.   In retrospect, however, he is chiefly remembered as a prodigious book collector who bequeathed enough volumes to his native city of Limerick to form the basis of a library \"for the free use of the citizens\", although it would only be in 1893 that the first public library in Limerick was actually opened.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife\\r\\nBennis was born in Corkamore (Clarina), County Limerick, in the southern part of Ireland. He was probably born in 1790, although there are also sources giving his birth year as 1793. His first work was as a grocer, but while still a young man he relocated to Liverpool in mainland Britain where, it is thought, he joined the Quakers.\\r\\nIn 1816 he published \"The Principles of the one Faith Professed by All Christians\", which would be reprinted in Paris 1826.   Bennis then moved to London, possibly also returning subsequently to work in Limerick, before in 1823 crossing The Channel and settling in Paris. Various further literary works followed including \"Traveller\\'s Pocket Diary and Student\\'s Journal\" and a \"Treatise on Life Assurance\".   He is believed to have undertaken further travel, but between 1830 and 1836 he was employed in Paris as the director of a \"Foreigners\\' Library\" (\" librairie des étrangers\") established in the city by the pioneering editor Martin Bossange and the industrialist-politician Antoine-Augustin Renouard.\\r\\nDuring his Paris years Bennis also took work as an insurance agent, and was at one stage employed as a librarian by the British Embassy. Meanwhile, his membership of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) lapsed, although he continued to espouse Quaker principals. He also edited \"Galignani\", a news journal described in several sources as \"The Times of Paris\". In 1854 he was honoured with the Legion of Honour, although at a detailed level sources differ over why.   One version is that he saved the life of King Louis Philippe when the king was subject to an assassination attempt, while another is content to record merely that in 1848 he saved the king\\'s life \"during a street fracas\". The statement that, \"at the time of the [1848] revolution, he peacefully retook the royal flag, for which he was knighted by the king,\" may or may not be an alternative reading of the same events.\\r\\nHe was still living in Paris at the time of the coup d\\'état of 1851, and lost a large amount of property in the disturbances that briefly ensued. A few years later it is reported that he came close to being burned to death when fire engulfed government bakeries at the time of the Crimean War. The incident also involved the destruction of many of his books.\\r\\nGeorge Geary Bennis died in Paris in January 1866, and was buried in the city.   Sources now focus on his will and estate.   His nephew and executor, Edward Bennis, arrived from Lancashire in England shortly after his death, to find that his uncle\\'s coin collection had already been stolen. Nevertheless, what remained was more than 10,000 books, and these in due course formed a substantial kernel for a public library in Limerick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Benjaminas Jakševičius (March 31, 1895 in Panevėžys – August 13, 1979 in Kaunas) was a Lithuanian sculptor and partisan. Together with his brother Vincentas and nephews Silvanas and Adomas, he contributed to religious art by building sacred statues and altars, mainly in Panevėžys, Švėkšna and various other parts of Lithuania. He also built several sculptures, predominantly religious ones, in Troškūnai, Kavarskas, Burbiškis, Upytė, Raguva and Pasvalys.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nJakševičius was the youngest among his brothers, born to a peasant family. His father Aleksandras was a carpenter and sculptor.\\r\\nIn 1915 he worked for his oldest brother, Vincentas. At the same year he was summoned to the civil service in the Tsarist army. He was released from the service later due to his illness and lived in Yekaterinburg Governorate for a while. In 1918 he came back to Lithuania, where he lived mostly in Švėkšna and Panevėžys from 1922 to 1925 while engaging in creating religious art. Later he moved to Kavarskas and married Elžbieta Striogaitė on November 28, 1925, with whom he had four children. However, he was soon left a widower, as his wife died in 1932, leaving four small children. Benjaminas Jakševičius lived in Kavarskas until 1945, at the same time traveling to other places where he worked as a sculptor and church decorator.\\r\\nIn July 1945, he joined anti-Soviet resistance movement and was a member of \"Liūtas\" and \"Žaibas\" squads (parts of Vytis district, codename Dzedunia and Šaltekšnis. He was caught in 1948 in Miknevičius\\' forest, not far away from Raguva and sentenced to 25 years of imprisonment in GULAG. He spent most of his prison term as a deportee in the Mordovian ASSR. In 1960s he was allowed to move to any Soviet republic, except Lithuanian SSR, but he came back to Lithuania nevertheless and was under surveillance by KGB until his death.\\r\\nJakševičius died on August 13, 1979, in Kaunas and was buried in Kavarskas Cemetery in the family grave with the white concrete sculpture of St. Mary created by him.\\r\\nTwo of his sons, Vytautas and Algimantas, were folk artists. His oldest daughter Irena Jakševičiūtė-Sabūnienė, a former active helper of Lithuanian partisans during the postwar years, was posthumously recognized as a Lithuanian freedom fighter (laisvės kovų dalyvis).\\r\\n\\r\\nLegacy\\r\\nThe wooden chess carved by Jakševičius and some of his photos are on exhibition in the Ninth Fort, as well as one family photo in Antanas Baranauskas and Antanas Vienuolis-Žukauskas memorial museum.\\r\\nMany sculptures and gravestones made by Jakševičius are a part of Lithuanian National heritage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Gintaras Karosas (born 25 June 1968 in Kryziokai, Vilnius district) is an artist who founded Europos Parkas and designed its landscape.\\r\\nKarosas organized several exhibitions of his graphic works as a secondary school student.

C. Sturmberg. In his apprenticeship he created, amongst other things, two angels for Privy Krabbe\\'s tomb at Roskilde Cathedral, and also helped with the stucco decorations at Fredensborg Palace. \\r\\nTo learn more, he went abroad visiting several cities in Germany and then travelled to Amsterdam, where he sought training with Van Luchtern. In 1727 he travelled to England and while in London worked for sculptors Laurent Delvaux from Ghent and Peter Scheemakers from Antwerp, the latter of which had also heard of Sturmberg\\'s pupils. Later Stanley\\'s self-employment and paling among other decoration of Lord Wilmington castle in Sussex, as he also did some major monuments. In 20 years, Stanley was in all England, he had 2 times married. His first wife, born Anna Allen, a tenant farmer\\'s daughter from Sussex, whom he had married in 1730, had died after 5 years of marriage, and he had then in 1737 married a pastor\\'s daughter from Hanover, Magdalene Margrethe Lindemann, who was the mother of 2 sons, one of which is the sculptor Carl Frederick Stanley.\\r\\nStanley had hardly thought of ever returning to Denmark, when he carried a notice from Copenhagen, Commander Gerner, who visited London, got a call there. Since both he and his wife agreed, wrought Gerner after his return through the county Danneskjold that King Christian VI of Denmark called Stanley and sent him raise money. Just as this was about to leave London, came after notification of the death of the king, but he nevertheless went away and after his arrival in Copenhagen gracious received by King Frederik V of Denmark, which awarded the artist an annual pension, gave him the promise of space as the fleet sculptor and let him assign a block of marble, that he might show them a sample of his art. Stanley was now a small group: \"Vertumnus, Pomona and Cupid\" (1749), a graceful rococo cabinet piece, which was bought immediately to museum (now in Aalborg Museum). The king took such pleasure in this work that he ordered a similar group: \"Venus, Adonis and Cupid\" (now in the marble garden, Fredensborg). Of Stanley other statues could include a Ceres and Diana (1757) in Fredensborg Marble Garden and Park as well as a flora for Rosenborg Garden. In addition, he performed a \"Ganymede with the eagle\" on what work he parade in 1752 as a member of the old Art Academy, since this 2 years later reorganiseredes, he became one of its professors. No major sculptor company he seems to have unfolded here at home. He has done a couple of monuments and must surely have produced more than statues of the above, but mostly he seems in his capacity hofbilledhugger (1755) that have been used to such things such as carrying out painting frames and model decorations at the royal trucks and at Academy of large gilded armchair. In his final years � from about 1753 � he was also linked to the oldest Danish porcelain factory at the Blue Tower. He delivered his owner, JG Mehlhorn, different models, and when Louis Fournier, who had made his first attempt at Stanley\\'s house on Christianshavn in 1760 took over the factory, he had oversight of its activities. Took a long time he did not this position when he died 17 February 1761.\\r\\nWhile Stanley, judging by his few surviving works by the artist does not reach beyond the mediocre, he must, in consequence his novel portrays B�sching, deserve the best credentials as a human being. He has not only been a man with an amiable and courteous creature, which won him his contemporaries\\' respect and love \", but in a rare degree been endowed with talents. He was very musical, singing and playing beautifully. Moreover, he wrote poems, and after his return and his death, he employed himself in translating English religious writings, including by Fielding and Doddrige, Translations, who lauded for their beautiful Danish language.

He left the island in 1960 and established residence in Miami, Florida, where he began his studies in architecture and engineering. As an art student, he was twice granted the Cintas fellowship from the International Institute of Education in New York, and obtained a Master of Arts Degree from the University of Miami in 1971.\\r\\nAfter teaching sculpture and design for a few years, Consuegra set his sights on creating, and established a studio in Barcelona.  He quickly developed a reputation as a ceramist and sculptor, and exhibited widely throughout France, Spain, Denmark, Switzerland, Russia and Serbia.  Upon his return to the US, he set up his primary studio in Miami, and spent over 30 years creating a large body work ranging in size from small-scale sculptures to monumental public art commissions.  Represented in both private and public collections across the globe, his work explores the subjects of cloning, education, law v. justice, the human body in motion, mythology, religion, and freedom.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\nAfter relocating to the United States in the 1960s, Consuegra studied the arts in Miami Dade College with fellow artists Emilio Falero and Rafael Soriano, and received his associate degree in 1967. He then received a Master of Fine Arts Degree from the University of Miami in 1971. He later taught as an art instructor in both Miami Dade College and Barry University.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolo exhibitions\\r\\nHe has had multiple solo exhibitions in Miami, including shows at educational institutions such as Miami Dade College in 1970 and 2006, Barry University in 1971, and Florida International University in 1973. He did a show in Boston\\'s Northeastern University in 2007 titled \"Freedom Birds\" and had other shows in Chicago, New York City, Athens, Georgia, and Puerto Rico. Internationally, he gave shows in Spain, France, Switzerland, Argentina, and Serbia.\\r\\n\\r\\nGroup exhibitions\\r\\nConsuegra also participated in several group exhibitions, including the International Artists Salon, Grenoble, France (1977), Forum Artis I, Copenhagen, Denmark (1978), WIZO Art ‘92’, Miami (1992), \"Sculpture in the Landscape,\" University of Miami (1995), \"31 Cuban Sculptors Exhibition,\" Miami Dade College (2009), \"Art Shanghai 2012,\" \"Art Fest at Doral\" (2012), and the Miami River Art Fair (2012).\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards\\r\\nConsuegra won several awards for his art, including the Miami Art Center\\'s Award for Sculpture in 1967, the University of Miami\\'s Hanson Award in 1968 and Helen Banks Memorial Award in 1969, the Cintas Foundation Fellowship (New York) in both 1972 and 1973, among others. In 2012 he was designated a U.S. Ambassador to promote Belgrade as a \"Capital of the Arts\" in 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollections\\r\\nRafael Consuegra\\'s work can be seen in the Lowe Art Museum of the University of Miami, and several noted Catholic institutions including the Agrupación Católica Universitaria of Miami, Belen Jesuit Preparatory School (for the Giants of Belen series), Saint Brendan Catholic School as well as many prominent Cuban art collections including the Permuy and Pinedo fine art collections.\\r\\nConsuegra was commissioned to produce numerous public artworks, and won a nationwide competition to represent the United States in an arts exchange program between the sister cities, Duluth, Minnesota, and Petrozavodsk, Russia. His winning sculpture, The Fishermen, is located in Petrozavodsk and is symbolic in nature, with the two fishermen representing the unity of the two sister cities. He also produced sculptures for the Milander Recreational Complex of Hialeah that were installed in 2015. On January 28, 2020, Consuegra\\'s sculpture MINOSO was erected in Optimist Park of Miami Lakes in honor of Cuban-American baseball player Minnie Minoso (1925–2015). In 2020 Consuegra was also commissioned by real estate developer and impact glass magnate Sam Moussa to create an abstract original metal sculpture for his private residence Aqua Azure.\\r\\n\\r\\nStyle\\r\\nConsuegra\\'s sculptures are known for their dynamic elements that give a sense of motion to metal, his preferred medium. At times it is an industrial, mechanized dynamism; at others it is a fluid and organic dynamism. He describes this as an ability to \"breathe life into metal.\" He also frequently uses color in his sculptures to enhance these features.\\r\\nHis painted work shows strong architectural influence and tends to be abstract and highly geometric. Across all mediums, Consuegra\\'s art varies between levels of high and intermediate abstraction, occasionally with spiritual and religious subject matter, such as crucifixes and angels. Consuegra tends to initial his works with \"RCC.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath and legacy\\r\\nConsuegra died on September 17, 2021, one day following his 80th birthday, of a heart attack. Consuegra was a founder of the Bird Road Arts District (BRAD) in the 1980s, where his studio was among the first to establish itself before the area was officially designated an arts district. The architectural influences in Consuegras art was credited as a key factor in inspiring Ignacio Permuy to enter the architecture profession; the two would later collaborate on several projects and exhibitions. Consuegra was also a key figure in the Permuy Gallery, one of the first Cuban art galleries in the United States, and assisted the Permuys in preparing the venue for its launch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Iván Navarro (born 1972 in Santiago, Chile) is a Chilean artist who works with light, mirrors, and glowing glass tubes to craft socially and politically relevant sculptures and installations.

Electricity was one of the tools of torture preferred by the Chilean government, but the piece also has local currency. On the paper seat, he has written the names of every individual executed in Florida by electric chair, to bear witness to the state\\'s record on capital punishment.\"\\r\\nNavarro also works with light and infinity mirrors, in which viewers lose themselves in an apparently infinite space, as neon phrases or structures loom out, and suggest what lies beyond. These abyss-like works can link back to Navarro\\'s fear of being abducted as a child. As he navigates his past, the artist readily admits, \"There is a certain amount of fear in my pieces\". In ‘Criminal Ladder’ (2005), Navarro created a 30-feet-high ladder made with fluorescent light tubes. On the tubes he has written the names of people who committed human rights abuses during the Pinochet time in power.\\r\\nHe is represented by Galerie Daniel Templon.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected exhibitions and works\\r\\n2019\\r\\nMACBA, Buenos Aires, Argentina\\r\\nThis Land is Your Land, currently installed at Navy Pier, Chicago, Illinois (July 27, 2018 - September 30, 2019)\\r\\n2018\\r\\nProstutopia, Galerie Templon, Brussels\\r\\nHangang Art Park Creation Project, Seoul, Korea \\r\\nPodium, Galerie Templon \\r\\n2017\\r\\nFanfare, Galerie Daniel Templon, Paris Rue Beauborg\\r\\nUntitled, The Nelson Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, MO  USA\\r\\n2016\\r\\nSummer Sculpture Exhibition, Paul Kasmin Gallery \\r\\nMute Parade, Paul Kasmin Gallery\\r\\nVigilantes, Museo del Hongo, Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Valdivia\\r\\n2014\\r\\nNacht und Nebel, Galerie Daniel Templon, Brussels\\r\\nThis Land is Your Land, originally installed at Madison Square Park, New York (February 20, 2014 - April 20, 2014) \\r\\n2013\\r\\nWhere is the Next War?, Galerie Daniel Templon, Paris\\r\\n2012\\r\\nImpenetrables, Art Kabinett, Paul Kasmin Gallery, Art Basel, Miami\\r\\nIván Navarro: Fluorescent Light Sculptures, Frost Museum of Art, Miami\\r\\nHeaven or Las Vegas, SCAD Museum of Art, Savannah, Georgia, US\\r\\nNacht und Nebel, Fondazione Volume!, Rome\\r\\n2011\\r\\nUNO Fence, Prospect.2 at UNO Gallery, New Orleans\\r\\nThe Armory Fence, Paul Kasmin Gallery at the Armory Show, New York\\r\\nHeaven or Las Vegas, Paul Kasmin Gallery, New York \\r\\n2010\\r\\nTener Dolor en el Cuerpo de Otro, Distrito 4, Madrid\\r\\nTierra de Nadie, Caja De Burgos, Burgos, Spain\\r\\nMissing, Chambre Blanche, Manif d´art 5, Catastrophe?, Quebec, Canada\\r\\n2009\\r\\nDie, Paul Kasmin Gallery, New York\\r\\nNowhere Man, Galerie Daniel Templon, Paris\\r\\nThreshold, 53rd Biennale di Venezia, Chilean Pavilion, Venice\\r\\nNowhere Man, Contemporary Art Center Towner, Eastbourne, UK\\r\\n2008\\r\\nAntifurniture, Galerie Daniel Templon, Paris\\r\\n2006\\r\\nSpy Glass, Galerie Daniel Templon, Paris\\r\\n2004\\r\\nJuice sucker, CSPS Legion Arts, Iowa, USA\\r\\nMonuments for D.

Rowling revealed on her website that many people have asked her to include an adult Dudley with a wizarding child in the epilogue of Deathly Hallows, and that she herself considered it, but decided upon reflection that any \"latent wizarding genes would never survive contact with Uncle Vernon\\'s DNA\" and thus she did not do so. Rowling says that Harry and Dudley would \"stay on Christmas card\" terms for the rest of their lives, and that Harry would take his family to visit Dudley\\'s when they were in the neighbourhood, but it was something that James Sirius, Albus Severus and Lily Luna \"would dread\". However, Dudley\\'s kids and Harry\\'s occasionally would \"get together while the adults sat in awkward silence\". In Harry Potter and the Cursed Child it is also mentioned that adult Dudley sent Harry his baby blanket, one of the two surviving possession of Harry\\'s from his parents. Dudley is portrayed by Harry Melling in the Harry Potter films. Melling had to wear a fat suit, as he lost a considerable amount of weight as the films progressed.\\r\\nMarge Dursley – Muggle sister of Vernon Dursley. Pam Ferris played Marge in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, in which she floats out of the house and into the sky after Harry inflates her.\\r\\nPetunia Dursley – Harry\\'s aunt, and his mother Lily\\'s sister.  Vernon\\'s wife and Dudley\\'s mother. In the film version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, she leaves Harry without showing any sentiment; however, in a deleted scene on the Blu-ray/DVD release, Petunia shows acknowledgment of the wizarding world, and ultimately deep sadness and remorse for the loss of her younger sister Lily, reminding Harry that she lost a sister as well. Actress Fiona Shaw portrays Petunia in the films, with Ariella Paradise playing her as a child.\\r\\nVernon Dursley – Harry Potter\\'s Muggle uncle. Petunia\\'s husband and Dudley\\'s father. Vernon is portrayed by Richard Griffiths in the films.\\r\\n\\r\\nE\\r\\nMarietta Edgecombe – Ravenclaw student one year above Harry.

During the Second Wizarding War, Hermione alters their memories, causing them to believe that they are called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, a childless couple who is moving to Australia, to protect them from Voldemort. After the War, she restores their true memories.\\r\\nAstoria Greengrass – Draco Malfoy\\'s wife. She died in 2019 due to her blood curse. She is three years younger than Draco, and the younger sister of one of Draco\\'s classmates from Slytherin. She is played by Jade Gordon in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2.\\r\\nGregorovitch – highly regarded Eastern European wandmaker.\\r\\nFenrir Greyback – Werewolf working for the Death Eaters.\\r\\nGellert Grindelwald () – Dark wizard who was jailed after Albus Dumbledore defeated him in the 1940s. Rowling claimed at a Q&A session that she implied Dumbledore being once in love with Grindelwald, and thus he had \\'lost his moral compass,\\' but she did not say whether those feelings were returned. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1, young Grindelwald is portrayed by Jamie Campbell Bower while the older Grindelwald is played by Michael Byrne. Grindelwald appears in the Fantastic Beasts film series, portrayed by Johnny Depp in the first two films. In the film series storyline, Grindelwald and Dumbledore have made a blood pact in their youth to never harm each other which Grindelwald sports in a vial while seeking a means to indirectly kill his former lover. He first appears in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, though he is disguised for most of the story as the American Auror Percival Graves, played by Colin Farrell, while seeking out an Obscurus whom he learned to be Credence Barebone. In Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, Grindelwald manages to manipulate both Credence and Queenie Goldstein to his side by promising the former he will tell him who he really is (supposedly Aurelius Dumbledore, a long lost brother to Albus and Aberforth) and the latter that she will be free to marry her No-Maj fiancé, Jacob Kowalski. Campbell Bower reprises his role as the teenaged version of the character in a brief flashback scene as well. In November 2020, Depp resigned from the role at the request of Warner Bros. due to his personal legal troubles. Later that month, it was reported that Mads Mikkelsen was in early talks to replace Depp as Grindelwald for the third film. On 25 November 2020, Warner Bros. officially announced that Mikkelsen would replace Depp. On replacing Depp, Mikkelsen noted that it would be a \"creative suicide\" to copy Depp\\'s \"masterful\" portrayal as Grindelwald, having developed his own take on the character, and admitted that a \"bridge\" should be needed between Depp\\'s performance and his own, having been a fan of Depp since his early films.\\r\\nWilhelmina Grubbly-Plank – Substitute Care of Magical Creatures professor during Harry\\'s fourth and fifth years.\\r\\nGodric Gryffindor – One of the four founders of Hogwarts.

Rowling...A Day in the Life documentary from ITV\\r\\nThe Harry Potter Lexicon\\'s page on the Dursley family', 'Winston Anthony Lloyd Cozier (10 July 1940 – 11 May 2016) was a Barbadian cricket journalist, writer, and radio commentator on West Indian cricket for over fifty years. Scyld Berry wrote that he was both the voice and the conscience of West Indian cricket, the latter because of his harsh criticism of the West Indian board for \"squandering the money and legacy that it had inherited\".\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nCozier was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, the son of Barbadian journalist Jimmy Cozier, who was the managing editor for the St Lucia Voice and founder of the Barbados Daily News. Cozier\\'s family descended from  Scottish labourers who had emigrated in the 18th century to Barbados. Cozier studied journalism at Carleton University, Ottawa, and began his reporting career in 1958.\\r\\nHe played hockey as a goalkeeper for Barbados and cricket as a batsman and wicket-keeper for local cricket clubs Wanderers and Carlton.\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalism\\r\\nHe became the editor of the Barbados Daily News in 1961, where he worked with retired cricketer Everton Weekes, and covered the West Indies tour to England in 1963. He was subsequently the cricket correspondent of the Barbados Advocate, and in 1973 he helped to set up The Daily Nation newspaper. He also wrote for the British newspaper The Independent.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommentating career\\r\\nHis first Test Match commentary on radio was on West Indies v Australia in 1965. He was a member of the BBC\\'s Test Match Special commentary team from 1966, and also commentated on television for Channel Nine in Australia and Sky Sports. During his commentating career, Cozier covered every Wisden Trophy series except one. Despite health problems, he commentated on the 2014/15 England tour of the West Indies. According to Vic Marks, \"Tony described the action succinctly and with an objectivity that is beyond many modern broadcasters.\"\\r\\nCozier was known for his knowledge of statistics; during a Marylebone Cricket Club tour in 1967, Brian Johnston played a practical joke on him by pretending that they were on air and asking him to recite the exact bowling figures and birthdays of the entire West Indies team, which he was naturally unable to do. Cozier was specifically requested by Kerry Packer to be one of the commentators for World Series Cricket; Cozier believed that the general public supported the series, and during a commentary stint in the series, he sang \"Blue Moon\". In 1994, Cozier wrote of Brian Lara\\'s record-breaking innings that \"there was no real surprise among his countrymen, simply the feeling that his inevitable date with destiny had arrived rather more suddenly than expected.\" Possibly his most famous line was in 1999, after West Indies were bowled out for 51 by Australia at the Queen\\'s Park Oval, he remarked \"Where does West Indies cricket go from ’ere?\". In 2007, Cozier used a lunch break in a Test match at the Riverside Ground to read a spoof email asking about cricket in Mexico; fellow commentator Jonathan Agnew had to explain the joke to him. He once remarked: \"The Queen\\'s Park Oval, exactly as its name suggests—absolutely round.\"\\r\\nThe parties that he hosted for his media colleagues, held at his small wooden holiday home on the east coast of the island whenever there was a Test match in Barbados, were described by Vic Marks as \"legendary\". They featured rum punch, a barbecue and beach cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nWriting\\r\\nCozier wrote the definitive The West Indies: 50 Years of Test Cricket, with a foreword by Garfield Sobers (1978). He was editor of The West Indies Cricket Annual for all its 22 editions. He edited the Wisden History of the World Cup and collaborated with Clive Lloyd and Michael Holding on their respective autobiographies, Living for Cricket and Whispering Death: The Life and Times of Michael Holding.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonours\\r\\nAs a tribute to his contributions to cricket, the press box at the Kensington Oval was named after him. Test Match Special producer Peter Baxter joked with Cozier that the press box was actually named after another Cozier, since both his father and son were journalists. In December 2011, he was awarded honorary life membership of the MCC for his contribution to cricket.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath\\r\\nCozier died from cancer on 11 May 2016 in Bridgetown, at the age of 75. Fellow cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew said: \"Tony was the master of going between TV and radio ball-by-ball commentary. He was the master of both\". The West Indies Cricket Board said: \"He represented West Indies wherever he went. He educated people around the world about our cricket, our people, our culture and who we are. His voice was strong and echoed around the cricket world.\"\\r\\nHe was survived by  his wife of more than fifty years, Jillian,  a son and daughter.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nWest Indies in India Nov 1974/Jan 1975 – Summary ESPNcricinfo – Excerpt from Cozier\\'s book, The West Indies: Fifty years of Test Cricket (1978).

A young schoolteacher in the Russian Empire by 1908, he wrote poetry and collected folklore emphasizing Bessarabia\\'s links with Romania, and associated with various founding figures of the Romanian nationalist movement, beginning with Ion Pelivan. Buzdugan was a far-left figure during the February Revolution, but eventually rallied with the National Moldavian Party in opposition to the socialists and the Bolsheviks. He vehemently supported the union of Bessarabia with Romania during the existence of an independent Moldavian Democratic Republic, and, as a member of its legislature (Sfatul Țării), worked to bring it about. Threatened by the Bolsheviks, he fled to Romania and returned with an expeditionary corps headed by General Ernest Broșteanu, being one of the delegates who voted for the union, and one of dignitaries who signed its proclamation.\\r\\nIn interwar Greater Romania, Buzdugan received mixed reviews as a neo-traditionalist poet, while also serving terms as a Bălți County representative in the Assembly of Deputies. There, he advocated decentralization and a system of zemstva, but opposed Bessarabian autonomy, while also becoming noted for his hawkish stance against the Soviet Union, his radicalized nationalism, and his antisemitic outbursts. He was successively a member of the Bessarabian Peasants\\' Party, the Peasants\\' Party, the National Peasants\\' Party, the Peasants\\' Party–Lupu, and the Democratic Nationalists. For a while, he was employed as a civil administrator, before delving in fascist politics with the Romanian Front.\\r\\nHis political activity made him a target of repression under the Romanian communist regime, but he avoided arrest by going into hiding during the late 1940s and early \\'50s. Protected by the literary critic Perpessicius, he later reemerged, but, until the time of his death, was only allowed to publish pseudonymous translations from Russian literature, culminating with a posthumous rendition of Eugene Onegin. Since the 1990s, his poetic work has been recovered and reassessed in both Romania and Moldova.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nEarly years\\r\\nAccording to updated reference works, the future Ion Buzdugan was born in 1887 in Brînzenii Noi (now in Telenești District, Moldova), the son of peasants Alexandru and Ecaterina Buzdâga, who also had seven daughters. One 1936 entry claims that he was born in 1889 in Buzdugeni. Both villages were at the time included in the Russian Empire\\'s Bessarabian Governorate, and the young man was educated at a teachers\\' seminary in Bayramcha. He later studied agriculture, law and literature in Russian schools in Kamianets-Podilskyi and Moscow. Buzdugan, who claimed to have lodged with, and befriended, the Ukrainian poet Ivan Franko, eventually took a license to practice law from Moscow University.\\r\\nInfluenced to some degree by the work of Mihai Eminescu, he began writing his own poetry, published in Bessarabian magazines from 1905, under the pseudonym Nică Romanaș (or Românaș, \"Nică the Romanian Fella\"). Other pen names he used include B. Cogâlnic, Ion Câmpeanu, and I. Dumbrăveanu. He became involved with the groups of Romanian nationalists then forming in the Governorate, writing for their newspaper Basarabia, and, while in Kamianets, establishing contacts with the Romanians east of Bessarabia.\\r\\nIn 1907–1909, a schoolteacher in Bursuceni, he associated the Romanian national club founded by judge Ion Pelivan. His activity there brought him under the watch of the Okhrana, and, during the subsequent clampdown, he received a punishment for having taught his students in Romanian. Nevertheless, he remained active in the nationalist circles and, by 1913, was in contact with Cuvânt Moldovenesc journal, which he also edited for a while, again as N. Romanaș. He also began a lifetime work of collecting Romanian folklore, and, despite such work being repressed by the Russian authorities, documented the folkloric links between Bessarabia and other Romanian-inhabited regions. The folk songs of his collections also pointed to the Bessarabians\\' dissatisfaction with Tsarist autocracy, against claims that they enjoyed that regime more than they supported Romania.\\r\\nBuzdugan volunteered as an officer in the Imperial Russian Army, engaged in the Romanian theater of war. At some point during the events of the Russian Revolution, he and his Bessarabian colleague, Gherman Pântea, rallied with the revolutionary far-left, joining the Socialist Revolutionary Party; according to other sources, they may have even been involved with the Bolsheviks. By the time of the February Revolution, Buzdugan had entered the Moldavian Soldiers\\' Organization in Odessa, and took up the task of propaganda work among the Bessarabian units of the Imperial Russian Army. He was still active as a writer, networking with his colleagues from Western Moldavia. By February 1917, he had joined the literary circle Academia Bârlădeană, becoming close friends with George Tutoveanu and Alexandru Vlahuță. While on the front lines, he helped save the life of the Romanian officer and fellow writer Camil Petrescu.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Moldavian Party\\r\\nAfter March 13, 1917, both Buzdugan and Pântea became members of Paul Gore\\'s National Moldavian Party (PNM), the driving force of Romanian nationalism in the former Governorate, and were co-opted on its steering committee. However, as later noted by the party colleague Pan Halippa, Buzdugan was categorically opposed to the PNM\\'s right-wing, which looked to \"Bessarabia\\'s secession from Russia and her Union with Romania.\" Taken by the Russian army to Iași, the provisional Romanian capital, he befriended Mihail Sadoveanu and other contributors to România newspaper. His mailing address was the paper\\'s headquarters, which was also the domicile of playwright Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea. He therefore kept contact with the Romanian nationalists, including the historian Nicolae Iorga. Iorga recalled that Buzdugan was agitated in favor of socialist reforms and critical of the Romanian King Ferdinand I, somewhat supportive of a Russian-backed uprising, and favoring mass desertion. At the time, he spoke a \"picturesque\" Moldavian dialect, mixed with Russian neologisms.\\r\\nOn April 10, Buzdugan attended the Bessarabian Schoolteachers\\' Congress, presided upon by Alexandr K. Schmidt and comprising educators of all nationalities. There, he agitated in favor of a split, calling on Romanian teachers to form their own \"cleanly Moldavian\" congress, and supporting the idea of intensive courses to formalize and standardize their language. Buzdugan sought to convince his public that what they called \"Moldavian\" was the same as Romanian, and to prove his point he read them fragments from the 1688 Cantacuzino Bible. He also advocated the introduction of the Latin alphabet, to replace Cyrillic everywhere, including in zemstva schools. In May, with such autonomist goals in mind, Buzdugan, Pântea and Anton Crihan founded the newspaper Pământ și Voe, styled \"Organ of the Moldavian Socialist Revolutionary Party\". Additionally, together with the playwright Sergiu Victor Cujbă, he founded a people\\'s university and a peasants\\' theater.\\r\\nBuzdugan, Grigore Cazacliu, Vasile Țanțu and Andrei Scobioală soon set up a Moldavian Committee of the Romanian War Front, which began collecting Romanian church literature and primers, to be used in the struggle against Russification. The committee watched with alarm as the Ukrainian People\\'s Republic made overtures to incorporate Bessarabia into her borders. The Ukrainian Rada received a letter of protest written for the Bessarabian soldiers\\' organization by Buzdugan. It argued that, \"on the basis of historical, ethnographic rights, of her distinct customs and of her economic situation\", Bessarabia had \"an imprescriptible right to complete autonomy.\" Buzdugan was also one of the founders of the PNM-and-Committee tribune, Soldatul Moldovan, and returned to his career in the Bessarabian press.\\r\\nAccording to Iorga, Buzdugan was already going through a \"taming\" process, and warned the Romanians that Russian radicals were plotting a coup. Buzdugan himself claimed to have met a congratulatory King Ferdinand, using the occasion to press him for a nationwide land reform. In late October 1917, he participated in the Moldavian Soldiers\\' Congress of Chișinău, where it was decided to form Sfatul Țării, the Bessarabian legislature. During the proceedings, Buzdugan and Toma Jalbă insisted in favor of annexing to Bessarabia the Romanian-speaking areas east of the river Dniester (Nistru); although this failed to occur, their speeches were welcomed with applause by other delegates. The Congress appointed him to an Organizational Bureau that also comprised Halippa, Ion Inculeț, Teofil Ioncu, and Pantelimon Erhan. It was the provisional governing body of the region, and wrote down that laws and regulations for the legislative election of that month.\\r\\nBuzdugan himself was elected to Sfatul Țării, representing Bălți County, and joined the Moldavian Bloc, a parliamentary club reuniting former PNM members (informally: \"Pelivan\\'s godsons\") with the other Romanian nationalists. Buzdugan and Erhan supported Pelivan as leader of Sfatul, clashing with the left-wing \"Peasants\\' Faction\", the Mensheviks led by Eugen Kenigschatz, and non-Romanian deputies such as Krste Misirkov. This coalition preferred the leftist Inculeț, who did not approve of Bessarabia\\'s secession from the Russian Republic. Against Buzdugan\\'s protests, Pelivan asked his followers to also support Inculeț.\\r\\nIn November 1917, during the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, Buzdugan was one of the secretaries of Bessarabian Soldiers\\' Congress, part of a presidium headed by Vasile Cijevschi. This assembly voted favorably on the region\\'s emancipation, referencing the right to self-determination. In December, Sfatul proclaimed the Moldavian Democratic Republic, a quasi-independent state. Pelivan and his \"godsons\", who were pushing for the union with Romania, found themselves harassed by Bolshevik groups such as Front-Odel (confederated with the Rumcherod and loyal to the new Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic). They began preparing for an armed confrontation. Buzdugan and Scobioală also acted as liaisons between the Romanian Land Forces, under Constantin Prezan, and the White Russians, represented locally by Dmitry Shcherbachev of the 7th Army.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnion process\\r\\nEventually, disguised as Russian soldiers, and accompanied by sailor Vasile Gafencu, the \"godsons\" left Chișinău and headed for Iași, where they contacted the Romanian Army. On January 12, the Romanians, under General Ernest Broșteanu, crossed the border to suppress the Bolshevik uprising (see Romanian military intervention in Bessarabia). Buzdugan, with Crihan, Pelivan, Gafencu, Țanțu and Gheorghe Buruiană, followed them closely. Later sources suggest that Buzdugan and his Moldavian Committee set up a unit of the Republican Army, which reportedly fought against the Bolsheviks during subsequent skirmishes.\\r\\nWhen the act of union as put up for debate in the Sfatul session of April 9 [O.S. March 27], 1918, Buzdugan was among the 86-member majority who voted in favor. During the preliminary talks, he had seconded the Romanian Prime Minister, Alexandru Marghiloman, reassuring the Peasant Faction, and Inculeț, that land reform would be enacted in Romania. By then a leader of the Moldavian Bloc, he urged his colleagues to support union as stemming from \"the principle of self-determination\", and \"the most revolutionary act in the history of our people\". As Sfatul Secretary, together with Inculeț, the President of the Republic, and Halippa, the Vice President, he signed into law the union proclamation. Buzdugan was also the one selected to read the proclamation in the plenum session.\\r\\nBuzdugan was working on a volume of patriotic poetry, which came out that year as Țara mea (\"My Country\"). In October 1918, Sfatul Țării\\'s eponymous journal put out his monograph on the history of boyardom and peasantry in Bessarabia. Late that November, he was reelected Secretary of Sfatul, in circumstances that were deemed illegal by the anti-unionist opposition; under his watch, unconditional union (which excluded the regionalist provisions of the March document) was put to the vote. Buzdugan joined Halippa, Pelivan, and Cazacliu on a Sfatul mission to Cernăuți, in Bukovina, and Alba Iulia, in Transylvania, where they were to attend popular assemblies confirming the establishment of Greater Romania. In Bukovina, Buzdugan expressed his enthusiasm for \"our national cause, the awakening of the entire nation between the Nistru and the Tisa.\" However, bedridden with the Spanish flu in Cernăuți, he was unable to follow Pelivan to Alba Iulia, and failed to witness Transylvania\\'s incorporation into Romania on December 1 (\"Great Union\").\\r\\nIn his last days as a Sfatul deputy, Buzdugan signed a protest addressed to the Romanian government of Ion I. C. Brătianu, citing cases of abuse by the Gendarme \"satraps\", including their alleged embezzlement of welfare supplies. The document warned that the nation was \"nowhere near to moral unity, to the one guarantee that formal union would be strengthened\". From January 1919, he was among the founders of a credit union, formed to assist Bessarabian peasants in view of the land reform. Its steering committee also included Halippa, Buruiană, Crihan, Vasile Bârcă, Teofil Ioncu, Vasile Mândrescu, Mihail Minciună, and Nicolae Suruceanu.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginnings in Greater Romania\\r\\nOn April 27, Buzdugan and many of his credit union colleagues rallied with the PNM\\'s successor, the Bessarabian Peasants\\' Party (PȚB). He was voted, with Pântea, a member of its Central Committee. He served continuously in Romania\\'s Assembly of Deputies, where he represented Bălți County, from November 1919 to July 1932. During his first term, he embraced leftist causes and \"leaned toward class struggle\", backing the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod-led coalition against the National Liberal Party. In March 1920, days after Vaida had been recalled by King Ferdinand, Buzdugan read out the PȚB\\'s protest against this coup.\\r\\nHe shared his party\\'s opposition to the policies of the new People\\'s Party government, and spoke out against its interventions in the local administration of Bessarabia. In July 1920, he took the rostrum to address the sacking of A. Crudu, the Prefect of Hotin County, claiming that the latter had been abused and humiliated by the authorities. Buzdugan rallied with the Halippa faction of the PȚB, which sought integration within the nationwide Peasants\\' Party (PȚ); the other wings, comprising Inculeț, Pântea and Pelivan, preferred independence. He was one of 9 parliamentarians who, together with Halippa and the non-PȚB agrarian theorist Constantin Stere, joined the PȚ in on July 18, 1921. Under Inculeț\\'s presidency, the PȚB excluded him on July 22.\\r\\nHis literary career took off, and his subsequent poetic work was soon taken up in literary newspapers and magazines all across Greater Romania. These include: Viața Romînească, Adevărul Literar și Artistic, Convorbiri Literare, Cuget Românesc, Gândirea, Luceafărul, Sburătorul, Convorbiri Literare, Flacăra, Lamura, and Drum Drept. He also became one of the staff poets at Sandu Teleajen\\'s review, Gând Românesc, in December 1921. Buzdugan was inducted into the Romanian Writers\\' Society, and co-founded the Bessarabian Writers\\' Society. Completing his studies at the University of Iași, he took a Doctorate in Political Economy from Cernăuți University.\\r\\n\\r\\nMade a Commander of both the Order of the Crown and the Star of Romania, as well as a recipient of the Ferdinand Medal, he took up practice as a lawyer, based in Bucharest and Bălți. His work in letters and folkloristics was collected in five retrospective volumes: Cântece din războiu (\"Songs from the War\", 1921), Cântece din stepă (\"Songs from the Steppe\", 1923), Cântece din Basarabia (\"Songs from Bessarabia\", two volumes: 1921, 1928), Miresme din stepă (\"Scents of the Steppe\", 1922), and a reprint of Țara mea (1928). In 1923, he won a national prize for poetry, granted by the Romanian Ministry of Arts. With Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică, C. S. Făgețel and N. A. Constantinescu, he also contributed a Festschrift for Iorga, published in 1921.\\r\\nHis poems, several of which dealt with themes of national fulfillment addressed to \"Mother-Country\", were often in dialect. According to literary historian George Călinescu, they \"sound to us like the French-Canadian language must sound to the French.\" Iorga described them as an expression of the \"primitive but powerful soul\", with rhymes of \"patient naivete\", and overall \"vastly superior\" to those of Alexei Mateevici. Eugen Lovinescu, the modernist doyen, found Miresme din stepă to be almost entirely \"un-literary\", only valid as \"proofs of Romanian cultural continuity during a time of alienation\": \"we can only approach [the book] for its cultural interest and while numbing our aesthetic scruples.\" A similar point was made by Șerban Cioculescu: \"I. Buzdugan\\'s poems cannot be said to be attractive in their beauty. All elements are lacking: no sensitivity, no imagination, no originality of ideas or artistic forms.\" He described Cântece din stepă as derivative from the works of Octavian Goga or Vasile Alecsandri, and instructive as to the comparative underdevelopment of Bessarabian literature. Cioculescu also noted that Buzdugan had not mastered Romanian grammar, his spelling errors \"all too numerous to be disregarded.\"\\r\\nAs noted by critic Răzvan Voncu, Buzdugan\\'s lyrical contribution stands for neo-traditionalism, in the manner of Gândirea writers, but is \"spontaneous\" and without influence from Expressionism. Voncu rates Buzdugan as a \"second-shelf\" traditionalist—ranking below Adrian Maniu or Aron Cotruș, but more valuable than Sandu Tudor, Radu Gyr, or Vintilă Ciocâlteu. According to writer Ion Țurcanu, his sonnet Păstorii (\"The Shepherds\") is \"of exceptional quality\", with its \"expression of the rustic universe\" and its grasp of \"the unsuspected materialness of silence.\" However, \"it is hard to comprehend why this literary phenomenon, that is a credit to Romanian literature, remains rather singular in Buzdugan\\'s work, and why he never made it as greater-caliber poet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPNȚ and PȚ–L\\r\\nReelected to the Assembly as one of the PȚ representatives for Bessarabia, Buzdugan focused on agrarian issues such as the liquidation of the zemstva, and defended the latter as tools of peasants\\' self-management. He and Halippa were also asked to respond in the Assembly about how they had carried out the land reform. He fought over the matter with Alexandru C. Constantinescu of the National Liberals, but also with more radical Bessarabian agrarianists such as Ludovic Dauș. His other focus was Romania\\'s defense against a hostile Soviet Union, which had not recognized Bessarabia as part of Romania. His speeches applauded by all political camps, Buzdugan depicted Romania as a bastion of Christendom and Western civilization. Unlike other PȚ deputies, he did not see Romania\\'s social backwardness as an impediment, and suggested that making Romanians \"healthy and strong\" would ensure that the country fulfilled her cultural mission. Documenting the Comintern links of the Romanian Communist Party, he also suggested that the PȚ itself was being infiltrated by the Krestintern. In December 1924, Buzdugan had a public row with Artur Văitoianu, Minister of Transport in the new Brătianu cabinet—at stake was the issue of the state railways, which Buzdugan deemed unfit for an imminent war with the Soviets.\\r\\nHis later speeches about Bessarabian unionism \"universally ignored\", Buzdugan continued to point out cases of abuse and corruption in his native region, protesting against the sentencing by a court-martial of his fellow deputy Gheorghe Zbornea, and warning that such displays weakened anti-communism in the region. His conflict with the Brătianu government became acute, with Buzdugan fully supporting Stere, who was sidelined by the majority deputies: reportedly, the poet-politician Goga threatened Buzdugan with a revolver during the session of May 4, 1925. On May 17, he took part in the opposition congress at Dacia Hall, alongside Peasantist and Democratic Nationalist figures, with Communist Party men present in the audience. This meeting was broken up by the army, and Buzdugan, although defended by Iorga, found himself stripped of his deputy\\'s seat on May 19.\\r\\nBuzdugan followed Halippa and Pelivan into National Peasants\\' Party (PNȚ), formed from the PȚ\\'s merger with the Romanian National Party. Reelected in June 1926, he became noted for his antisemitic outbursts, taking the rostrum to address the issue of anti-Jewish disturbances at Cernăuți. Scholar Irina Livezeanu describes Buzdugan\\'s speech as one \"studded with anti-Semitic buzzwords\" and \"racist commonplaces\". He accused the Jews of provoking vague acts of violence to \"harm Romania\"; however, taking sides with the National-Christian Defense League students, he warned that the Jews could expect pogroms to occur. In February 1927, he defected to the Peasants\\' Party–Lupu (PȚ–L), serving on its executive committee alongside figures such as Nicolae L. Lupu and Ioan Pangal.\\r\\nDuring the 10th anniversary of the Bessarabian union, Buzdugan showed himself optimistic about the prospects of the region, against Halippa and Ioncu, who shared a bleaker outlook. In November 1928, at another festive meeting of the former Sfatul deputies, he clashed with Stere, who demanded that a resolution be adopted in support of \"people\\'s liberties\", and against the \"exceptional laws\". Buzdugan reproached Stere: \"So you came here for politicking.\" In his new term in the Assembly after the 1928 election, he took a position against Bessarabian autonomism, describing it as a \"Russian formula\" and a \"worrisome\" threat. Buzdugan also questioned the PNȚ government over its alleged tolerance of communist and pro-Soviet activities in Bessarabia. Nevertheless, he endorsed decentralization of the lesser government bodies, \"for it won\\'t do that someone should have to travel back and forth from Bessarabia to Bucharest\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIorga cabinet and Romanian Front\\r\\nBuzdugan was active with Pântea within the Union of Reserve Officers, which collaborated with the Siguranța agency in combating communism, \"finding out and unmasking those who carried out revolutionary propaganda\"; a rough equivalent of the old regime\\'s gentry assembly, it also demanded pay raises for Bessarabians in the military. In 1930, he sided with the nationalist groups in the Assembly against the PNȚ government, which had promised to ethnic Bulgarians to enact a liberal land law in Southern Dobruja, thus limiting Romanian colonization attempts. As noted by Iorga, Buzdugan, \"babbling as usual\", attacked the Dobrujan Bulgarian deputies as proxies of the Bulgarian Tsardom. Buzdugan also had a verbal bout with Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu of the far-left Peasant Workers\\' Bloc, calling him \"a parasite of the working class\".\\r\\nCo-opted by Iorga during his technocratic administration of 1931–1932, he served as Undersecretary of State in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. As Iorga recounts, Buzdugan and Vladimir Cristi were imposed on him by a Bessarabian \"bloc\" of deputies, \"who wished to have their representative in Government\"—this was against rumors that he was personally close to Buzdugan and intended to make him his son-in-law. In order to join the government in January 1932, Buzdugan quarrelled with Lupu and the PȚ–L, who remained in the opposition. He also defeated Pântea for the position, although the latter was a favorite of the new king, Carol II. Buzdugan depicted Pântea as an unreliable former Bolshevik, and also as a pawn of the National Liberals. At the time, Pamfil Șeicaru and Curentul daily mounted a campaign against Buzdugan, alleging that he had illegally pocketed money from the industrial concern in Bălți. He responded by suing Șeicaru.\\r\\nBy May 1932, Buzdugan had been singled out by Carol II as one of the \"ridiculous\" government members whom Iorga was ordered to replace; he handed in his resignation \"dignified, without any expectations.\" After Iorga\\'s fall in the elections of 1932, Buzdugan dedicated himself to another calling: supporting anti-Soviet and White émigré circles in Romania. According to the reports of Siguranța spies, he intended to relaunch the Golos Bukharesta, a Russian anti-communist newspaper, and to obtain support for the Whites from the cabinet of Gheorghe Tătărescu. By January 1934, he had joined Iorga\\'s Democratic Nationalists, heading their organization in Bălți County. In 1935, Buzdugan veered to the far-right, joining the PNȚ\\'s \"semi-fascist\" splinter group, the Romanian Front, and heading its own Bălți County chapter.\\r\\nAfter introducing the Romanian public to the Russian avant-garde (with translations that Iorga deems \"very good\"), Buzdugan focused on the works of Pushkin, publishing in Gândirea a rendition of his \"Gypsies\" (1935). At the time, scholar Eufrosina Dvoichenko described it as \"the best\" of several Romanian attempts to translate the poem. In 1937, he produced a new volume of his own poems, Păstori de timpuri (\"Time-herders\"). A contributor to Halippa\\'s Viața Basarabiei magazine, in 1939 he became a co-founder of the Bessarabian Writers\\' Society. However, according to sociologist Petru Negură, Buzdugan\\'s verse was entirely backward and irrelevant by 1930: \"Just as agriculturalists were facing the devastating effects of the Great Depression, the peasants depicted in poems by Pan Halippa or Ion Buzdugan [...] continued to cultivate their land with love and judiciousness.\"\\r\\nBuzdugan escaped Bessarabia following the first Soviet occupation of 1940, while former members of the Union of Reserve Officers, including Emanoil Catelli, were jailed or deported. Reconciling with Inculeț and Pântea, he joined their Bessarabian Circle, an advocacy group based in Bucharest. In 1942, at the height of World War II, his Metanii de luceferi (\"Genuflections of the Evening Stars\") came out. It was to be his final published work in poetry, although three others exist as manuscripts. During the Soviet push into Bessarabia at the start of 1944, Buzdugan was offered a temporary home in Brezoi, Vâlcea County (southwestern Romania). With the help of Alexandru Leca Morariu, his verse continued to see print in magazines like Gazeta de Transilvania and Revista Bucovinei.\\r\\n\\r\\nRepression and death\\r\\nEven before the official establishment of a Romanian communist regime in 1948, Buzdugan came to the attention of the Soviet occupation forces, which began procedures to arrest or deport him as a political undesirable. In 1945, he was hiding in monastic clothes at Bistrița Monastery, where he met the medical assistant and monk-in-training Valeriu Anania. In his memoirs, Anania describes Buzdugan as a mediocre poet, his Orthodox devotional pieces comparable to Lord\\'s Army hymns, adding: \"He grew old with the impression of him being a great poet, and I became awfully sad at the thought that I might grow old with that same impression of myself.\" According to Anania, Buzdugan also angered the starets with his urban demeanor, and left for Bucharest when \"times changed for the better\".\\r\\nFrom 1948, Buzdugan escaped threats of arrest by hiding in an attic at Blaj, where he was protected by Ioan Suciu, a bishop of the Greek-Catholic Church. When the Church itself was dissolved, he hid in private homes, or dressed up as a traveling monk and sought refuge in monasteries—at Tăuni and Târgu Mureș, later at Bujoreni and Polovragi. In 1950, he had returned to Bucharest, living with his mother, who was in her nineties, and four of his sisters on Vlad Județul Street, Vitan. That year, Buzdugan began writing to the literary critic Perpessicius. The latter arranged for Buzdugan to heal a fractured right arm with help from the poet-doctor Virgiliu Moscovici-Monda. In 1951, commissioned by Perpessicius to translate Eugene Onegin, Buzdugan announced that he was working on his own epic poem, retelling the death of Miron Costin—the latter, if it exists, was never published. In April 1953, he wrote again to announce his \"hurried departure\" to Bazna, Transylvania, where his sister ran a summer camp. With the onset of de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union, Romanian literati could hope for a more tolerant regime. In this climate, Buzdugan began frequenting a literary circle in the Bucharest home of Ion Larian and Paraschiva Postolache, where he met young writers such as Eugen Barbu and C. D. Zeletin. Other senior guests included Virgil Carianopol, N. Crevedia, and Radu D. Rosetti.\\r\\nFrom ca. 1955, when Romanian communism turned increasingly nationalist and anti-Soviet, Buzdugan was allowed a quiet return to publishing, but had to limit himself to translation work. His earlier volumes had been taken out of the public libraries, along with many other books referencing Bessarabia. In 1956, Steaua magazine hosted Buzdugan\\'s version of Pushkin\\'s \"To Ovid\". Reportedly, he claimed to have authored a translation of Boris Godunov, stolen from him by the regime\\'s poet-laureate, Victor Eftimiu. Using the pseudonym B. I. Alion, he published in 1962 a version of Maxim Gorky\\'s tale, \"A Girl and Death\". His other contributions were renditions from Blok, Bunin, Kotsiubynsky, Lermontov, Shevchenko, and Yesenin.\\r\\nTerminally ill with cancer, Buzdugan spent his final months at Filantropia Hospital, where he was visited by C. D. Zeletin, who recorded his memoirs. He died on January 27, 1967, in Bucharest, and was buried at Bellu cemetery. His funeral was attended by Halippa and Pântea, and saw them speaking publicly for the reincorporation of Bessarabia into Romania; reportedly, the speech was tolerated by the authorities, which were allowing non-politicized expressions of nationalist fervor. However, fearing a backlash, several guests left when Pântea began describing Buzdugan\\'s career in politics. Later that year, Buzdugan\\'s Eugene Onegin appeared under his real name, with a foreword by Perpessicius. According to philologist Ioana Pârvulescu, it was a \"good translation\". The last of his surviving sisters, Eleonora, died in 1995.\\r\\nDespite the mood of liberalization in the 1950s and \\'60s, Buzdugan\\'s name was rarely invoked in print before the Romanian Revolution of 1989, and only two new books of literary criticism mentioned his work. In the Moldavian SSR, his name was banned from all reference. This stance changed after 1989. In independent Moldova, his work saw print in anthologies, including Literatura din Basarabia în secolul XX and Poeți din Basarabia. In Romania, Zeletin reprinted Miresme din stepă and published his correspondence; his collected works appeared as 2 volumes, in 2014, at Chișinău. In 2012, the editor had noted that Buzdugan, his friend, \"is nonetheless forgotten, [...] even today, when the history of our stolen provinces is being combed through.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Summer Hoyland is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Jordy Lucas. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 20 May 2002. The character was originally played by Marisa Siketa from her arrival to her departure in 2005 and her subsequent returns in 2006 and 2007. In October 2009, it was announced that the character was to return to the show. Siketa auditioned for her previous role, but producers felt the character had evolved too much. They decided to cast Lucas instead after she came to their attention during Dolly magazine\\'s \"Neighbours Next Big Stars\" competition. Summer returned on 11 February 2010. Lucas announced her departure from Neighbours in September 2012 and Summer departed on 10 January 2013. Lucas reprised the role on 30 November 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasting\\r\\nMarisa Siketa had previously completed three years of acting training before she auditioned for the role of Summer on Neighbours. Siketa played the role for four years, before she chose to quit the show and concentrate on her studies. She made brief appearances in 2006 and 2007. In October 2009, it was revealed that the character would be returning to Neighbours the following year. Executive producer, Susan Bower had decided to bring the character back, but announced that Siketa would not be reprising the role. In an interview with Inside Soap, Bower revealed that they had auditioned Siketa, but felt the character had evolved too much and decided against casting her again. Jordy Lucas was chosen for the role instead. Lucas came to the attention of the producers when she came second in Dolly magazine\\'s \"Neighbours Next Big Stars\" competition. She then successfully auditioned for the role of Summer.\\r\\nDuring an interview with Network Ten Lucas said of her casting, \"I would have never of thought that this would be happening, I would have never ever-ever imagined in a million years that I would be playing a role that I used to watch on TV years ago, it\\'s really surreal.\" She also added \"There was a lot of pressure taking on a role that was already played by Marisa Siketa, I watched footage back and she did a really good job establishing the character and she obviously had a big following\". In a different interview Lucas said that the return would bring a whole new mystery to the character. She added her worries of playing a character that was already established with viewers stating \"There is a bit of added pressure – people already have an idea of how they want her to be. I did a lot of research into the role, but Summer has come back as a young woman after leaving as a child, so it\\'s only fair that people should expect a change\". In December 2011, a reporter for the Herald Sun announced Lucas had extended her contract with Neighbours until late 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment\\r\\nCharacterisation\\r\\nDuring her early days in the series Summer was known for being naughty and the \"resident trouble-maker.\" A writer for the BBC\\'s Neighbours website described her as having \"The face of angel and the mind of a career criminal.\" Summer was also very good at wrapping people around her finger. The BBC writer called Summer a \"mini-Mrs Mangel in the making\" as she often overheard things she should not and gossiped about them afterwards. Siketa described Summer as \"Funny, Mischievous, Bubbly.\" Summer did have another side to her personality, in which she was \"delightful, kind and considerate.\" She developed close relationships with older women following her mother\\'s death and she loved her brother, Boyd (Kyal Marsh). When her father started dating Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), Summer accepted the relationship and was more mature about it than Boyd.\\r\\nUpon her return in 2010, Summer had changed her attitude. Of this, Lucas stated \"She\\'s more feisty than anything. She has her own moral code and set of rules that she wants to stick by, and she\\'s not afraid to bend the rules at school. But when it comes down to it, she\\'s a sensitive girl and she\\'s very kind. She wants to look after people.\" Lucas also described the character on another occasion stating that Summer was now smart and feisty, and she stands up for the things she believes in. Of her dramatic change in personality she said: \"I think at the same time she\\'s gone away, she\\'s matured into a young woman, she has changed, so there are things that are going to be different about her, so as much as people are going to miss Marisa playing her hopefully they can embrace the new Summer.\"\\r\\nSummer is expelled from her music school and she comes to Ramsay Street to see Steph and prove to her father that she can get things sorted out. Summer has grown up, but Lucas said there is a \"crazy, reckless side to her.\" Susan Bower said that Summer and Natasha Williams (Valentina Novakovic) spark because Summer is \"a feminist, and she fights for causes and sticks up for the underdog\". Lucas explained that when Summer and Natasha are friends, the storylines tend to be lighter. However, when they are at each other, Lucas said it is fun as she and Novakovic are not like that in real life, so it is something different for them. When asked if she was similar to Summer, Lucas revealed \"I certainly have an opinion about lots of different subjects, but I don\\'t go to the lengths that Summer does.\" Lucas told the Herald Sun in May 2011 that she would like to see Summer \"go off the rails a bit more\" and start hanging out with a bad crowd as she is \"such a goody two shoes.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nChris Pappas\\r\\nSummer begins a relationship with Chris Pappas (James Mason) in May 2010. They date for three months before Chris reveals that he is gay. Summer initially takes the news well. She plays it down and explains that she is dealing with it. The Herald Sun\\'s Alice Clarke said Summer dealt with the news that Chris was gay \"extremely well.\" When asked if she would react in the same way as Summer, Lucas told Clarke \"There\\'s no denying that it would be a really difficult thing to go through, but you have to respect that it\\'s an even harder thing that they\\'re going through.\" Chris and Summer become good friends and Mason said \"Chris is determined to help Summer through whatever comes in the future, and really just stick by her. It\\'s a good friendship that evolves even though it\\'s been such an ordeal.\" Chris later tries to prove to Summer that he is a good friend by playing Cupid for her. Chris becomes a wingman for Summer and helps her to find someone else to date as he feels guilty for hurting her. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said Summer\\'s friendship with Chris has been nice to watch and when he asked Lucas if she was happy that Mason is staying in the show, she said, \"I think it\\'s fantastic that the Chris character is staying on and will evolve over time – he provides a voice of reason for the other characters who all fire up so quickly. And I love working with James [Mason], he is one of the nicest people you\\'ll ever meet.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRelationship with Andrew Robinson\\r\\nSummer becomes involved in a love triangle with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Patrick Smith) and Natasha Williams. Summer likes Andrew, but he breaks her heart by dating Natasha. Andrew thinks he is doing the right thing, as Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) warned him to stay away and Summer is dealing with her stepmother being sent to jail. Andrew and Natasha organise a party and Andrew is surprised at his feelings when Summer turns up. He later expresses concern for her when she collapses, which makes Natasha realise she needs to get rid of Summer. Natasha warns Summer to stay away from Andrew, while she is in the hospital. Lucas told Holy Soap that she was backing the pairing of Summer and Andrew and wanted things between them to move along. She said \"It\\'s a lot of fun to play the tortured teenager in love, but it\\'s been going on for about a year and half now so it would be nice for Summer to just have something that really makes her happy in her life. Every time she gets something that makes her happy, something happens to destroy it.\" Lucas revealed that fans had sent her videos of Summer and Andrew they had made on YouTube and she commented that \"Everyone seems to love Andrew and Summer.\"\\r\\nIn December 2010, it was revealed that Summer and Andrew would give into their feelings for each other before they become trapped in a house fire. The storyline begins when Andrew becomes jealous of Summer going on a date with his business partner, Tomas Bersky (Tim Munley). Andrew tries to warn Summer off Tomas, which makes Summer happy as this means he likes her. While Tomas is \"charming\", Andrew is the one Summer wants and she would not consider being with anyone else. Lucas explained that Andrew believed Summer was too good for him, but seeing her with Tomas is a wake-up call. Summer tells Andrew that she has wanted to be with him since the day they met and Lucas said \"Summer has desperately wanted to say this to Andrew for so long, but she\\'s been scared of getting hurt. Andrew also knows that if he doesn\\'t act now and let Summer know how he feels, it\\'ll be too late.\" While they are together, a fire breaks out and Natasha goes in to save Summer, not knowing Andrew is there too. Summer and Lyn move in with the Williams family and Summer is forced to watch Andrew carry on his relationship with Natasha.\\r\\nSummer is devastated when Andrew tells her Natasha is pregnant and she believes they are back at square one. When she was asked if Summer would try to win Andrew back, Lucas said \"No, because she feels she has to respect the fact that Andrew has this responsibility of having a child. I don\\'t think this is something she wants to get involved with.\" Summer becomes suspicious about Natasha\\'s pregnancy as she knows that Natasha likes to play games. Though she knows she does not want to come across as a jealous ex-girlfriend. Summer discovers that Natasha\\'s ultrasound scan photos are fake and she realises Natasha has been lying about being pregnant. Summer then reveals the truth to Andrew. Summer later tells Andrew that they cannot be together and Lucas explained that Summer feels that the situation with Natasha never would have happened if they had not cheated on her. She added \"And I guess she feels that the whole situation is way too messy and that Andrew has a whole lot of baggage to sort out, and this is not the right time to start a relationship.\" Lucas admitted that Summer and Andrew deserve to be together as they have been through a lot and they have a good chemistry. When asked if Summer and Natasha would be friends again, Lucas said \"They have both done the wrong thing. Summer cheated with her boyfriend, Tash with the fake pregnancy; they have both been guilty of doing the wrong thing.\"\\r\\nLucas told What\\'s on TV that Summer and Andrew \"have a lot to resolve\" after the conclusion to the love triangle storyline. Natasha decides to get Summer and Andrew back together, making Summer suspicious of her motives. Natasha tries to get Andrew and Summer to talk through their issues, but when they get together they argue and Andrew claims Summer is always judging him. When asked if Summer is aware of this, Lucas said \"Not initially. Summer does have a tendency to take the high moral ground on issues and is very head-strong. Admitting she is wrong or overreacting doesn\\'t come easily to her!\" Andrew then kisses Lisa Devine (Sophie Tilson) in front of Summer, leaving her gutted. Lucas said that while it would be nice for Summer and Andrew to end up together, she believes they are more interesting when their relationship is strained. When Lyn announces the family is relocating to Bendigo, Summer is devastated at the thought of leaving Andrew. However, just as Lyn is driving out of Ramsay Street, Andrew runs after the car and declares his love for Summer. Summer decides to stay in Erinsborough to be with Andrew and they finally begin a relationship.\\r\\nIn January 2012, it was confirmed Summer and Andrew would break up during the year. Lucas told Digital Spy\\'s Daniel Kilkelly that Summer is going to be heartbroken when she realises her relationship with Andrew is not working out as well as it was. The actress explained \"Summer absolutely loves Andrew and she doesn\\'t want to break up with him, but the pressure of their relationship and them going in different directions definitely takes a toll on them.\" Lucas believed the couple would be over for good, but stated they could reunite in the future as they love each other so much. Lucas revealed there could be a potential love interest for Summer, but she realises that she still hurts over Andrew and decides to focus on herself a bit more.\\r\\n\\r\\nCheating\\r\\nSummer decides to pursue a career in journalism and has to put together a portfolio for the university course she wants to get on to. She decides to use camera footage of the Erinsborough History Wall being completed as the subject of her portfolio. However, Summer is devastated when Andrew tells her he has accidentally deleted the footage. Lucas said the project meant a lot to Summer, but she is more upset about Andrew\\'s casual attitude to the accident. Viewers were aware that Andrew deleted the footage on purpose to protect his cousin, Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer), a student teacher who was captured on tape kissing a pupil. When asked what Summer would have done if she had seen the footage, Lucas said \"Summer always tries to do the right thing and I\\'m not sure she would have thought making it public would have been the right thing to do, so I\\'m leaning toward protecting Kate.\" Losing the footage puts Summer\\'s portfolio in jeopardy, so she is determined to do well in her English VCE exam. However, her study plans have been derailed in the process and she decides to cheat. Lucas told Digital Spy\\'s Daniel Kilkelly that Summer photographs some of the verses she needs for the exam with her phone, before hiding it in the bathroom. When she becomes stuck on a question, she elects to go ahead with her plan to cheat, without thinking she could be caught. Summer goes to the bathroom to check her phone and Michael enters asking what is taking so long. Summer\\'s phone starts to ring and Michael realises what is going on. He and Summer then fight over the phone.\\r\\nDuring the argument, Michael collapses and Summer blames herself. Lucas told a writer for TV Week \"She knows Michael\\'s been going through a lot of stress with Tash and her finding out about her mum\\'s death, but at that moment, Summer feels like, \\'I\\'m the straw that broke the camel\\'s back\\'.\" Summer calls an ambulance and she feels even more guilty when she is branded a hero. When Michael recovers, Summer is surprised to discover that he does not remember their encounter. Summer\\'s secret starts to eat away at her and she confides in Chris and Andrew, who have two different views on the situation. Andrew encourages Summer to keep quiet and she does. In February 2012, Kilkelly reported the storyline would be picked up again when Michael remembers what happened. Michael\\'s memories of that day return and he threatens to report Summer for cheating. Andrew intervenes and begs Michael to keep quiet, while Natasha is \"furious\" to learn about Summer\\'s lies. Summer owns up to cheating in her exam and she is forced to go back to school and repeat Year 12.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeparture\\r\\nIn early September 2012, Lucas announced her departure from Neighbours. Of her decision to leave, she stated \"I\\'ve had a fantastic three years at Neighbours and I am really looking forward to what my future has to offer.\" Lucas filmed her final scenes during the week beginning 17 September. A Channel 5 website writer said the character\\'s exit storyline would \"raise a few eyebrows, with Summer finding herself embroiled in a romance that will test her moral compass.\" On 11 September, Darren Devlyn from news.com.au reported that Summer would develop a relationship with older journalist Bradley Fox (Aaron Jeffery). The relationship sees Summer leave \"amid controversy.\" Her departure aired on 10 January 2013.\\r\\nOn 20 November 2023, Lucas announced on social media that she would be returning to the serial for a short stint by posting a photo with Jackie Woodburne (who plays Susan Kennedy). Of her return, she stated, \"So special to head back to the place that changed my life forever.\" Lucas had previously explained that she would be open to returning to Neighbours, telling a reporter for Digital Spy: \"I have nothing but fond memories of my time on the show, and if they were to ask me back, I would jump at the chance.\" Lucas returned as part of a storyline that sees past students protesting against the closure of Erinsborough High School.\\r\\n\\r\\nStorylines\\r\\n2002–2007\\r\\nSummer arrives in Ramsay Street selling boxes of stale chocolates, while claiming the money would be going to charity.

Susan is unaware of this until Summer informs her.\\r\\n\\r\\nReception\\r\\nWhile played by Siketa, a writer for the BBC said Summer\\'s most notable moment was \"Rescuing Ben.\" The actress earned two nominations for Best Young Actor at the Inside Soap Awards in 2004 and 2005 for her portrayal of Summer. Michael Idato of The Sydney Morning Herald branded Summer \"precociously slappable\". Following the character\\'s recast, the Daily Record said \"The last time we saw her, she was a cute little blonde-haired poppet. Now she\\'s got a completely different head – and nobody on Ramsay Street seems to have noticed.\" TV Week writer Carolyn Stewart said that she is not normally a fan of recasts, but Summer\\'s has been \"great\". Holy Soap describe Summer\\'s most memorable moment as \"When she burst back into Erinsborough looking for Steph, and was mistaken for a burglar\". Anthony D. Langford from gay website, AfterElton said he liked Summer and found her role during Chris\\'s coming out storyline \"just as interesting as Chris\\'s problems.\" Langford added \"Her boyfriend coming out of the closet has clearly put her on the edge, and given her temper, once she unloads on Chris, it\\'s not going to be pretty.\" In December 2010, a reporter for The Sun-Herald said the \"romantic tension\" between Summer and Andrew had been simmering for a while and they wondered if they would make their feelings known to each other in the season finale.\\r\\nJim Schembri of The Age was positive towards Summer and Andrew\\'s relationship and he was surprised with the quality of the storyline\\'s direction. He said \"To wit: the romantic tension between hot-as teens Andrew (Jordan Smith) and Summer (Jordy Lucas) is so thick the cafe is now using it as a sandwich spread. They want to get it on with each other but while Andrew wants to start up again, Summer doesn\\'t. They both reconsider their relationship prospects and come the big moment she\\'s willing to give it a go. But before she can get a word out, he says he\\'s reversed his policy and agrees with the advice he\\'s been getting that it\\'d be a bad idea. It\\'s a subtly played scene, with the standard of direction frankly outdoing what long-suffering film critics often see in Australian feature films.\" In March 2011, Holy Soap ran a poll on who Andrew should be with and 16,000 votes were cast, with 92% of viewers choosing Summer. Of Summer, Cameron Adams of the Herald Sun said \"Wowsers. Reformed bad girl Summer (Jordy Lucas) has bloomed.

(In Spanish)', 'John Howard Clark (15 January 1830 – 20 May 1878) was editor of The South Australian Register from 1870 to 1877 and was responsible for its Echoes from the Bush column and closely associated with its Geoffry Crabthorn persona.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly years\\r\\nJohn was born in Birmingham, son of Francis Clark (1799 – 1853), a silversmith also born in Birmingham. Grandfather Thomas Clark ran a school for boys, then a factory.\\r\\nHis mother Caroline (1800 – 16 September 1877) was a daughter of mathematician Thomas Wright Hill (24 April 1763 – 13 June 1851), founder of what became Hazelwood School in Birmingham under her brother Rowland Hill (famous for inventing penny postage and important in South Australian history as the Secretary to the Commissioners for the Colonization of South Australia). Her eldest brother, Matthew Davenport Hill, was Recorder of Birmingham, penal reformer and a supporter of Edward Gibbon Wakefield.\\r\\nJohn was educated at Birmingham and Edgbaston Proprietary School and King\\'s College London, where John Lorenzo Young (later to found the Adelaide Educational Institution) was a fellow student.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nClark worked for a time at an iron smelter in Dudley, but after a bout of serious illness, emigrated with his parents to Adelaide, South Australia, arriving on the Fatima in June 1850. After a short period of work as an assayer, he joined his father as accountant in the firm which, with A. Sidney Clark as proprietor in 1853, became Francis Clark and Sons, hardware importers and shipping agents of Blyth Street. John Howard Clark became one of the colony\\'s most sought-after accountants, as with the 1862 audit of the Duryea mine.\\r\\nClark was an adept writer and contributed to the Register (one of those who used the nom de plume \"Pleeceman X\"), and the Telegraph, an evening paper whose editor, Frederick Sinnett, was a close friend.\\r\\nIn October 1865 Clark purchased a share of the Register and Observer from The Hon. Joseph Fisher (1834–1907), the other proprietors being William Kyffin Thomas and Edward William Andrews. He also took Fisher\\'s place as its commercial manager. He was appointed editor in 1870.  (The proprietors at the time of his funeral were William Kyffin Thomas, C. Day, J. H. Finlayson and Robert Kyffin Thomas.)\\r\\nThe seven years of Clark\\'s editorship marked a high point in the history of The Register. According to one commentator \"... his well-balanced intellect, his judicially impartial mind, and great knowledge of men and things, stood him in good stead. ... the paper has become a greater power in the state ... not merely for its independence of thought, but for its fearlessness in tho expression of its opinions, and its aim to be at all times fair and just. ... many of his articles upon education and financial questions were very powerful. ... (he was) an ardent disciple of Stuart Mill, and the abolition of not a few of the restrictions upon trade in the colony is in a measure due to his advocacy\".\\r\\nThe one aspect of his incumbency for which he is best remembered is the weekly \"Echoes from the Bush\" column, conducted under the pseudonym \"Geoffry Crabthorn\" with its frequently powerful advocacy and pungent satire. \"It is understood that he originated (this column). Whether he did or not I am not in a position to say but that he contributed to it some of the best productions of his mind I know full well. The \"Echoes\" have been read and appreciated in the other colonies – in fact, at this moment I have a letter from one of the ablest writers in Sydney, who says, what we here are prepared to endorse, that \"Geoffry Crabthorn\" at his best has no peer in Australia.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOther interests\\r\\nClark acted as landlord for his uncle Rowland Hill, who owned two parcels of land later the site of by the Parkside Mental Hospital.\\r\\nClark was a supporter of the Adelaide Educational Institution and close friend of its founder, John L. Young.\\r\\nClark was an active member of the Unitarian Christian Church in Wakefield Street, and prominent in the appointment in 1855 of its first full-time minister, the Rev. John Crawford Woods.\\r\\nClark helped found the Adelaide Philosophical Society, and was secretary from its formation in 1853 until 1862. His brother A. Sidney Clark later held that position.\\r\\nHe helped found the South Australian Institute, and was for many years one of its Governors, resigning in 1873 because of ill-health.\\r\\nIn 1860 he joined the South Australian Volunteer Military Force and rose to the rank of Major in 1866. In 1869 he was obliged to decline further promotion because of ill-health. The Volunteer Force was a militia formed in 1855 for the defence of the colony of South Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamily\\r\\nMost, if not all, of Clark\\'s children were given the middle name \"Howard\" and he was himself generally referred to as though \"Howard Clark\" were his surname.\\r\\nClark\\'s seven brothers included Algernon Sidney Clark (1826 – 16 February 1908), M(atthew) Symonds Clark (c. 1839 – 10 July 1920), who married Euphemia Martin on 29 August 1874 (and was father of engineer Edward Vincent Clark), and Henry Septimus Clark (died February 1864). \\r\\nHis three sisters included (Caroline) Emily Clark (1824–1911) founder, with Catherine Helen Spence, of the \"Boarding-out Society\", a scheme for finding homes for destitute children and Susan Mary Clark who on 8 May 1866 married Joseph Crompton (1842–1901), who with her brother Henry, founded Stonyfell winery.\\r\\nHe married Lucy Martin (26 August 1839 – 3 May 1863) in the Unitarian Church in Wakefield Street on 15 October 1858. (Lucy was a daughter of Edward Montgomrey Martin and Ann née Thornton.) They lived in Hazelwood Cottage (named after the Birmingham school, and commemorated in the present-day suburb of Hazelwood Park.) on Greenhill Road, Knightsbridge.\\r\\nLucy gave birth to\\r\\n\\r\\nFrancis Howard Clark (22 September 1859 – 17 June 1945), a prizewinning student at Adelaide Educational Institution 1871–1876. He married Edith Mary Smith (1861 – 17 July 1950) on 5 June 1890.\\r\\nEllen Howard \"Nellie\" Clark (30 July 1861 – 4 November 1936) married William George Auld, son of William Patrick Auld, on 12 August 1893.\\r\\nLucy Howard Clark (27 April 1863 – 30 January 1940) married (Anglican) Rev.

He sculpted a number of life-size and small bronzes based on Greco-Roman mythological themes in Europe as well as a wide number of bas-reliefs, busts, funerary monuments, and statues throughout Denmark, the German Confederation, and Italy. Emigrating to the United States in 1886, he once more produced a number of sculptures for private citizens. His most noted American works were a statue of a soldier for a Battle of the Alamo memorial in Texas, a statue of Benjamin Franklin for the World\\'s Columbian Exposition in 1893, a statue group in Chicago commemorating the Fort Dearborn Massacre, and the General William Tecumseh Sherman Monument in Washington, D.C.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nRohl-Smith was born on April 3, 1848, in Roskilde, Denmark, to Caspar Wilhelm Smith and Johanne Marie Frederikke Sophie R�hl Smith. His father was a philologist at the University of Copenhagen. As a child, Rohl-Smith exhibited an artistic nature and was making sculptures out of any materials he could find.\\r\\nRohl-Smith studied at the Copenhagen Academy under Herman Wilhelm Bissen beginning in 1865, and graduated in 1869. During his education, he won several prizes for his work. He then studied under Albert Wolff at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin from 1870 to 1872. His 1872 bronze Wounded Philoctetes won a gold medal, and was purchased by the King of Greece. He completed additional studies in Rome, Vienna, and Paris from 1877 to 1881. While in Rome, he executed another major work, Bellerophon, in 1872. It was purchased by the Danish embassy in Rome.\\r\\nRohl-Smith became a professor at the Copenhagen Academy in 1885.\\r\\nRohl-Smith was already recognized as a prominent sculptor in Denmark and Austria-Hungary. He contributed a number of architectural figures for Frederik\\'s Church (also known as the Marmorkirken, or Marble Church) in Copenhagen, the Austrian Parliament Building in Vienna (the Akroterie, and the Winged Nike over the main entrance), and for numerous parks and public spaces in Denmark, the North German Confederation, and states of the former German Confederation. Perhaps his best known work in Europe was a bronze statue of Ajax, commissioned in 1878 for the second Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen. It won an Honorable Mention at the art exhibit at the Paris World\\'s Fair of 1878. It was destroyed in the 1884 fire which consumed the palace.\\r\\nAt some point before leaving Denmark for the United States, he married his wife, Sara.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmerican career\\r\\nIn 1886, Rohl-Smith emigrated to the United States and became an American citizen. Although the sculptor had used the last name Smith in Denmark, he began using the name Rohl-Smith in the U.S. He settled in New York City, and worked at the Hecla Iron Works in Brooklyn and then at the Perth Amboy Terra Cotta Company in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. Between 1886 and 1889, he executed numerous sculptures of famous people in bas-relief and busts. He also designed a number of larger-than-life funerary statues and monuments for famous and wealthy individuals in Boston, Massachusetts; Memphis, Tennessee; and Louisville, Kentucky. One of these included the funerary monument to William W. Belknap in Arlington National Cemetery near Washington, D.C.\\r\\nRohl-Smith moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1889. He executed a funerary monument to Henry A. Montgomery, a prominent local businessman and politician and founder in 1888 of the New Memphis Jockey Club. (Montgomery had died during the club\\'s opening.) In 1890, Rohl-Smith was asked to implement Harriet A. Ketcham\\'s design for the Iowa Soldiers and Sailors Monument. Ketcham\\'s design was chosen by the state legislature in 1888, but she died of a stroke in 1890. Rohl-Smith was commissioned to finish the work, which was completed in 1896.\\r\\nRohl-Smith\\'s most important works prior to 1892 were his Alamo soldier and statue of Judge Reid. The Texas Legislature commissioned James Senille Clark, a well-known manufacturer of stock monuments, to erect a memorial to the Battle of the Alamo on the grounds of the state capitol. Clark, in turn, commissioned Rohl-Smith in 1891 to sculpt the bronze statue of the soldier atop the monument. It is the oldest bronze statue in Texas. Rohl-Smith\\'s other notable American work at this time was a statue of Kentucky Superior Court Judge Richard Reid.\\r\\n\\r\\nFranklin statue and rise to fame\\r\\nRohl-Smith moved to Chicago in 1891. His next important American work came in 1892. The commission was for a plaster statue of a young Benjamin Franklin holding a kite for the 1893 World\\'s Columbian Exposition. Rohl-Smith\\'s prestige was such that he was also named Royal Danish Commissioner to the fair. The Franklin statue was widely praised. In 1894, it was gifted to the University of Pennysylvania, where it stood until it decayed in 1895. Around this time, Rohl-Smith became associated with Peter Emil Dreier, a Danish American lawyer and Danish consul in Chicago. Dreier\\'s large circle of friends included many prominent painters and sculptors, and Rohl-Smith\\'s fame began to spread in the artistic community.\\r\\nThe praise for the Franklin statue caught the attention of Chicago industrialist George Pullman, who commissioned Rohl-Smith\\'s next great work. Pullman\\'s Chicago mansion was built on or near the site of the 1812 Fort Dearborn Massacre, in which 28 men, 12 children, and two women were killed by rogue warriors of the Potawatomi Native American tribe. In 1893, Pullman commissioned Rohl-Smith to create a memorial to the Fort Dearborn Massacre (whose 85th anniversary was approaching). After researching the event with his wife, Rohl-Smith decided that the most important and dramatic part of the narrative was the incident in which a rogue warrior is prevented from killing Margaret Helm and her child by the Potawatomi chief Black Partridge. Dr. Isaac Van Voorhees lies dying beneath Helm\\'s feet. Two members of the Lakota nation, Kicking Bear and Short Bull, were imprisoned at nearby Fort Sheridan for having fired at United States Army troops during the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890. Short Bull posed as the less muscular, younger warrior attempting to kill Helm, while Kicking Bear posed as Black Partridge. Pullman donated the sculpture to the city of Chicago. Pullman was so pleased with the memorial that in 1895 he commissioned Rohl-Smith to sculpt bas-relief portraits of his parents for Pullman Memorial Universalist Church in Albion, New York.\\r\\nFrom 1891 to 1897, Rohl-Smith continued to produce an extensive number of bas-reliefs, busts, and statues of famous people.\\r\\n\\r\\nSherman monument\\r\\nRohl-Smith received his last, and perhaps greatest, commission in 1895. Renowned American Civil War Major General William Tecumseh Sherman died on February 14, 1891. On July 5, 1892, Congress enacted legislation authorizing a General William Tecumseh Sherman Monument and establishing the Sherman Memorial Commission. In 1895, the Sherman Memorial Commission issued a call for proposals for an equestrian statue of Sherman. A committee of the National Sculpture Society agreed to judge the submissions. When the competition closed on December 31, 1894, 23 sculptors had submitted proposals. Models of all the proposed statues were exhibited in Washington, D.C., to large crowds. The submission by Carl Rohl-Smith generated the most popular acclaim. The National Sculpture Society (NSS) narrowed the submissions down to a short list of four. The submission by Rohl-Smith did not make the short list; indeed, it was ranked almost dead last by the NSS committee. On May 27, the Sherman Memorial Commission overruled the judging committee and chose Rohl-Smith\\'s design. The National Sculpture Society was outraged, and protested the award strongly to the memorial commission and the press. The New York Times called the decision \"one of the most discreditable events ever in the annals of the public art of the United States\". Senator Edward O. Wolcott sponsored legislation to investigate the award process. Although his resolution was not successful, the Senate debate over the award process was rancorous and showed the Senate\\'s deep distrust of \"art experts\". Rohl-Smith was accused of using political influence to win the commission, an accusation he vehemently denied. After two months of protests, the National Sculpture Society ceased to contest the award.\\r\\nAfter winning the Sherman Monument commission, Rohl-Smith moved to Washington, D.C., in 1897 and set up a studio on the White House grounds next to the memorial\\'s location. A large, barn-like structure was built on Treasury Place NW.  With a front door extending 50 feet (15 m) high, verandas on three sides, lean-tos in the rear for mixing of plaster, tall windows, and a tin roof, the structure was intended not only to function as a workshop for the construction of a life-size model of the Sherman monument but also as living quarters for the Rohl-Smiths.\\r\\nCarl Rohl-Smith never saw his Sherman Monument completed.  He died in Copenhagen in August 1900, and was buried in Vestre Cemetery.\\r\\nAlthough the government determined that the contract with Rohl-Smith was null after his death, the memorial commission agreed to allow Rohl-Smith\\'s assistant and wife, Sara, to oversee the statue\\'s completion. Mrs. Rohl-Smith asked sculptors Theo Kitson, Bush Brown, and Jens Ferdinand Willumsen to help with the statue\\'s completion. Later reports do not mention Brown or Willumsen\\'s work on the monument, but Lauritz Jensen worked on the main statue, while Danish sculptor Stephen Sinding modelled the War and Peace figures. Sinding created plaster models for these pieces from Rohl-Smith\\'s sketches. But upon review, the postures and sizes of the two figures were found not to harmonize with the rest of the monument. Sigvald Asbjornsen remodelled them. As Rohl-Smith had already completed three of the four soldier figures on the corners of the monument, Sigvald Asbjornsen completed the fourth. Sources differ as to whether Asbjornsen completed the artilleryman or the cavalryman. Kitson completed the medallions which depicted the corps commanders who served under Sherman. Jensen completed the four bas relief panels based on work already completed by Rohl-Smith, as well as completing the badge (eagle) of the Army of the Tennessee. The design for the stone pedestal was complete at the time of Rohl-Smith\\'s death. The monument was dedicated by President Theodore Roosevelt on October 15, 1903.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath\\r\\nRohl-Smith fell ill with malaria and returned to Europe in June 1896, where he stayed until the fall. Although Rohl-Smith returned to the United States, his ongoing ill health (due to another attack of malaria) kept him from working on the Sherman statue through October 1898. Ill health continued to plague him. By March 1900, he had only completed the design for the pedestal (which had been erected) and three of the four corner \"sentry\" figures. Only sketches had been made for the equestrian statue itself, the side panels, the \"War\" and \"Peace\" statue groups, and the medallions.\\r\\nRohl-Smith departed Washington for Denmark in July 1900 to escape the city\\'s severe summer heat and humidity. In August 1900, Rohl-Smith became suddenly ill. He died of Bright\\'s disease at St. Josef\\'s Hospital in Copenhagen on August 22, 1900, with his wife at his side.\\r\\nSara Rohl-Smith died in Copenhagen in August 1921.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable works\\r\\nBellerophon, Danish embassy, Rome, Italy, 1872.\\r\\nAkroterie and Winged Nike, Austrian Parliament Building, Vienna, Austria, c. 1874 to 1883.\\r\\nAjax, Christiansborg Palace, Copenhagen, Denmark, 1878 (now lost).\\r\\nApollo and Diana, Pan and Daphne, Summer, Winter (architectural sculpture), Eremitage Palace, Dyrehaven, Denmark, 1881�1886.\\r\\nSaint Athanasius, Saint Irenaeus of Lyon, John the Baptist, Moses (architectural sculpture), Marmorkirken (The Marble Church), Copenhagen, Denmark, 1883�1884.\\r\\nBacchante Group, private collection, United States, 1885.\\r\\nYoung Benjamin Franklin With Kite, World\\'s Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois, United States, 1893 (now lost).\\r\\nThe Fort Dearborn Massacre Monument, Chicago History Museum, Chicago, Illinois, United States, 1893.\\r\\nBas-relief portraits of Emily Caroline Pullman and James Lewis Pullman, Pullman Memorial Universalist Church, Albion, New York, United States, 1895.\\r\\nEquestrian Statue of General John M.

He attended Trinity College Dublin and is believed to have been a soldier in the British army at one time. On leaving college, he went to London and in the course of four years spent his inheritance of �8,000, meanwhile editing a periodical in aid of the World\\'s Fair of 1851. About 1852 he emigrated to the United States, in the process changing his name to Fitz James, and thenceforth he devoted his attention to literature.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was in college he had shown an aptitude for writing verse, and two of his poems�Loch Ine and Irish Castles�were published in The Ballads of Ireland (1856). His earliest writings in the United States were contributed to the Lantern, which was then edited by John Brougham. Subsequently, he wrote for the Home Journal, the New York Times, and the American Whig Review. His first important literary connection was with Harper\\'s Magazine, and beginning in February 1853, with The Two Skulls, he contributed more than sixty articles in prose and verse to that periodical.  He likewise wrote for the New York Saturday Press, Putnam\\'s Magazine, Vanity Fair, and the Atlantic Monthly. To the latter, he sent \"The Diamond Lens\" (1858) and \"The Wonder Smith\" (1859). \"The Diamond Lens\" is probably his most famous short story, and tells the story of a scientist who invents a powerful microscope and discovers a beautiful female in a microscopic world inside a drop of water. H.P. Lovecraft was an admirer of the work. \"The Wonder Smith\" is an early predecessor of robot rebellion, where toys possessed by evil spirits are transformed into living automata who turn against their creators. His 1858 short story \"From Hand to Mouth\" has been referred to as \"the single most striking example of surrealistic fiction to pre-date Alice in Wonderland\"  \"What Was It? A Mystery\" (1859) is one of the earliest known examples of invisibility in fiction.\\r\\nHe was also employed in writing plays. For James W. Wallack he made A Gentleman from Ireland, which held the boards for a generation. He also wrote and adapted other pieces for the theatres, but they had a shorter existence. In New York, he at once associated with the brilliant set of contemporary Bohemians, among whom he was ranked as the ablest. At the weekly dinners that were given by John Brougham, or at the nightly suppers at Pfaff\\'s on Broadway, he was the soul of the entertainment.\\r\\nWhen the American Civil War began in 1861, O\\'Brien joined the 7th regiment of the New York National Guard, hoping to be sent to the front. He was stationed at Camp Cameron outside Washington, D.C. for six weeks. When his regiment returned to New York he received an appointment on the staff of General Frederick W. Lander. He was severely wounded in a skirmish on 26 February 1862, and lingered until April, when he died of tetanus at Cumberland, Maryland.\\r\\nHis friend, William Winter, collected The Poems and Stories of Fitz James O\\'Brien, to which are added personal recollections by old associates that survived him.  Mr. Winter also wrote a chapter on O\\'Brien in his book Brown Heath and Blue Bells (New York, 1895).

He composed histories, grammars, and summaries of philosophy for his young pupils and led them into political opposition to the Russian rule. His idealistic pedagogues influenced many Georgian intellectuals and poets, including Nikoloz Baratashvili, who combined modern nationalism with European Romanticism.

First published as a series of short stories and novellas from 1942 to 1950, and subsequently in three collections, for nearly thirty years the series was a trilogy: Foundation (1951); Foundation and Empire (1952); and Second Foundation (1953). It won the one-time Hugo Award for \"Best All-Time Series\" in 1966. Asimov later added new volumes, with two sequels, Foundation\\'s Edge (1982) and Foundation and Earth (1986), and two prequels, Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1993).\\r\\nThe premise of the stories is that in the waning days of a future Galactic Empire, the mathematician Hari Seldon spends his life developing a theory of psychohistory, a new and effective mathematics of sociology. Using statistical laws of mass action, it can predict the future of large populations. Seldon foresees the imminent fall of the Empire, which encompasses the entire Milky Way, and a Dark Age lasting 30,000 years before a second empire arises. Although the momentum of the Empire\\'s fall is too great to stop, Seldon devises a plan by which \"the onrushing mass of events must be deflected just a little\" to eventually limit this interregnum to just one thousand years.\\r\\nThe plot of the Foundation series spans centuries, and its various characters each appear in one or two of its nine installments.:\\u200a2,\\u200a5\\u200a Charles Elkins described its characters as \"undifferentiated and one-dimensional\" speaking with an \"impoverished vocabulary\". He wrote that their consciousness \"shows absolutely no historical development and hence fails to evoke in the reader any feeling for the future universe they inhabit\". Elkins argued that characterization in general is subordinated to the overall conception of Asimov\\'s project. James E. Gunn wrote that though the series of lead characters Lathan Devers, Salvor Hardin, Limmar Ponyets and Hober Mallow \"may seem interchangeable\", they are \"as differentiated as the personages in most histories.\":\\u200a35\\u200a\\r\\nThrough the eyes of the characters the inevitability of the forces of history, made manifest in the Seldon Plan, is demonstrated to the reader repeatedly. Elkins sees the characters in Foundation not as \"tragic heroes. They are nondescript pawns, unable to take their destiny into their own hands.\" Only those elite few characters who understand the Plan can be considered free, with the Mule through his non-human psychic powers as the only exception. But while Elkins attributes the Foundation series a sense of \"pervading fatalism\", Gunn and Nicolas David Gevers point out that the obstacles presented in Asimov\\'s galactic history are overcome by active individual characters \"through the initiative and competence which the Foundations nurture in their citizens\".:\\u200a44\\u200a:\\u200a56\\u200a Donald E. Palumbo asserts that it is exactly the \"flatness of character and setting\" which permit the series \"to be a masterpiece\".:\\u200a3\\u200a The heroism and depth of individual characters is consciously taken back by Asimov for the true hero of the series to stand out: \"the sublime history of humankind itself\".:\\u200a46\\u200a\\r\\nAn eight-part radio adaptation of the original three novels, called The Foundation Trilogy, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 1973.\\r\\nIn 2021, Apple TV+ premiered a television series adaptation of the novels, Foundation, created by David S. Goyer and Josh Friedman. In 2023, Asimov\\'s daughter Robyn Asimov, an executive producer for the series, said:\\r\\n\\r\\nI love the character development. That was not my father\\'s strong suit, and not necessarily his interest per se. It was all about the storytelling, and he did that so well that it was okay that the characters were a bit flat. What David [S. Goyer] did was especially ... I love the Cleon story. He gave life to these characters, and it brought the story to another level. The story was great anyway, but I think if, if my father had lived to see this, I think he would have been very, very impressed. My father would have loved to have seen the characters come to life. That\\'s something that was not in his wheelhouse per se. And I think this would have excited him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDucem Barr\\r\\nIn the Foundation and Empire (1952) story \"The General\", Imperial General Bel Riose of Siwenna coerces Ducem Barr to aid him in his persecution of the Foundation, which Riose hopes to destroy both as a perceived threat to the Galactic Empire and to further his own ambitions.:\\u200a26\\u200a Barr is Riose\\'s best choice as an \"expert\" on the Foundation, his father Onum having met Foundation-aligned Master Trader Hober Mallow during the events of \"The Merchant Princes\" in Foundation (1951). Barr aligns himself with Lathan Devers, a Foundation trader who has let himself be captured by Riose to disrupt the general\\'s operation from the inside. When Devers\\' machinations are exposed, Barr helps him escape further interrogation by knocking Riose unconscious and fleeing the planet with Devers in tow. They travel to the Imperial capital planet, Trantor, and plot to implicate Riose and Emperor Cleon II\\'s Privy Secretary Ammel Brodrig in a nonexistent conspiracy to overthrow Cleon. Though Barr and Devers are caught by the Secret Police, they escape and later learn that Riose and Brodrig have been arrested for treason and executed.:\\u200a26\\u200a\\r\\nJosh Wimmer and Alasdair Wilkins of Gizmodo described Barr as an old revolutionary and assassin who \"hates the Empire like no other character in the series\", and sees the Foundation\\'s predictions about the fall of the Empire as the vengeance he could never have imagined for his lost family and ruined planet. In the last chapter, Asimov uses the character of Barr to explain the political dynamics of why Riose would never have been able to defeat the Foundation: a strong emperor\\'s sense of self-preservation would never allow him to tolerate a subordinate who develops potentially threatening power.:\\u200a26\\u200a Wimmer and Wilkens called Barr a \"great character ... and his world-weary pragmatism coupled with supreme faith in the Seldon Plan is an intriguing combination.\"\\r\\nBarr is voiced by Peter Howell in episode four \"The General\" of the 1973 BBC Radio 4 adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nBarr is portrayed by Jesper Christensen in season two of the 2021 Apple TV+ television series adaptation Foundation. In the 2023 episode \"A Glimpse of Darkness\", Barr witnesses a presentation on Siwenna by High Claric Poly Verisof and Brother Constant of the Church of the Galactic Spirit, extolling the virtues of the Foundation and Seldon\\'s predictions. He records it using special technology in his left eye. In \"Where the Stars are Scattered Thinly\", Bel Riose and his husband/second-in-command Glawen Curr visit Barr to follow up on the recording. Barr, an Imperial loyalist, has been sending reports to the Empire for 40 years, none of which have been acknowledged until now. Riose and Curr learn that the Foundation has provided the clarics with auras, protective force shield technology forbidden to everyone except the Emperors, and whisper-ships, a Foundation-created type of jumpship which can perform faster-than-light travel without requiring a Spacer to navigate. When a mob of villagers arrives for the Imperials, Barr helps them escape and asks Riose to shoot him to death, so that he may avoid interrogation and torture. Riose kills Barr and flees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBail Channis\\r\\nIn the Second Foundation (1953) story \"Part I: Search by the Mule\", the Mule has yet to find the elusive Second Foundation. He sends his agent Han Pritcher on his sixth search, this time accompanied Bail Channis, the only one of the Mule\\'s followers who is \"Unconverted\", or not influenced by the Mule\\'s psychic powers to serve him. The Mule tells Pritcher that Channis\\'s untainted mind will allow him to be more capable of making intuitive leaps which might help in the search. In fact, the Mule has determined that Channis is a Second Foundation agent who intends to lead the Mule into a trap. Secretly followed by the Mule and his fleet, Channis leads the search to the desolate planet Tazenda, a plausible location for the Second Foundation. On a nearby world, Rossem, Pritcher draws his atomic blaster on Channis, who he now suspects to be an agent of the Second Foundation. Pritcher is correct, but Channis possesses a psychic ability similar to the Mule\\'s and uses it to free Pritcher from the Mule\\'s control. The Mule appears, and reveals that his fleet has destroyed Tazenda. The Mule uses mental torture to extract the true location of the Second Foundation from Channis\\'s mind: Rossem. The First Speaker of the Second Foundation arrives and informs the Mule that he has been defeated. Channis had been preprogrammed to believe that the Second Foundation is on Rossem, but it is not. Second Foundation agents have traveled to Kalgan and the Foundation worlds to undo the Mule\\'s Conversions and orchestrate an insurrection, and his fleet is too far away to prevent it. When the Mule experiences a moment of despair, the First Speaker is able to seize control of and alter his mind: he will return to Kalgan and live out the rest of his life as a peaceful despot. Channis\\'s mind is later restored by the First Speaker.\\r\\nChannis is voiced by Trader Faulkner in episode seven \"The Mule Finds\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cleons\\r\\nIntroduced in Foundation and Empire in \"The General\", Cleon II is the last great Emperor of the Galactic Empire. Threatened by the rising power and popularity of one of his own generals, Bel Riose, Cleon has him recalled and executed for treason.:\\u200a26\\u200a Wimmer and Wilkins described Cleon II as \"the aging, infirmed emperor whose great mind has been let down by his faltering body.\" Nicholas David Gevers suggested that Cleon II is based on the Byzantine emperor Justinian I.:\\u200a57\\u200a Cleon II is voiced by William Fox in episode four \"The General\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nIn the prequel novel Prelude to Foundation (1988), Emperor Cleon I learns of mathematician Hari Seldon\\'s nascent concept of psychohistory, which might theoretically make it possible to predict the future. Brought before Cleon, Seldon emphasizes his belief that developing it as a science is likely impossible. Subsequently, interest in Seldon\\'s work by unknown parties puts him in danger, convincing him of psychohistory\\'s potential importance.:\\u200a213–215\\u200a Wimmer and Wilkens described Cleon as \"basically decent but woefully inadequate\" but also \"a fairly entertaining character, who has me absolutely convinced that ruling a whole galaxy could be just a drag if you were born at the wrong time\".\\r\\nIn Forward the Foundation (1993), Seldon and his foster son Raych thwart the scheme of populist Jo-Jo Joranum to become Cleon\\'s First Minister and then overthrow him. The emperor subsequently appoints Seldon as his First Minister. Joranum\\'s associate Gambol Deen Namarti\\'s own plan to assassinate Seldon using a drugged Raych is also foiled, but Cleon is killed by a gardener trying to avoid promotion. A military government subsequently takes over, lasting for a decade.:\\u200a222\\u200a\\r\\nIn the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation, the 12,000-year-old Empire has been ruled for 400 years by a revolving trio of Cleon I clones: Brother Day (portrayed by Lee Pace), a Cleon in his prime; Brother Dusk (portrayed by Terrence Mann), a retired and aging Cleon who serves in an advisory role; and Brother Dawn (played by Cooper Carter as a child and Cassian Bilton as a young adult), a young Cleon being trained to succeed Brother Day. Though cloning does not factor in Asimov\\'s novels, the television series introduces a \"Genetic Dynasty\", surreptitiously administered for centuries by the regal Lady Demerzel, secretly a unique, ageless robot.\\r\\n\\r\\nArcadia \"Arkady\" Darell\\r\\nIn the Second Foundation story  \"Part II: Search by the Foundation\", Arcadia \"Arkady\" Darell is the 14-year-old daughter of Dr. Toran Darell II, and granddaughter of Bayta and Toran Darell. She has a keen sense of observation and deduction, and has learned that her Foundation member father is part of a cabal seeking the secret location of the Second Foundation. Arkady stows away with Foundation agent Homir Munn when he travels to the planet Kalgan to search for clues to the Second Foundation\\'s location. Munn is rebuffed by Lord Stettin, the current warlord of Kalgan, but Arkady manipulates his flighty consort, Lady Callia, to persuade Stettin to allow librarian Munn access to the Mule\\'s palace for research purposes. Stettin becomes suspicious of Munn and arrests him. Stettin also shows interest in marrying Arkady, and she escapes with help of Lady Callia. At the spaceport, Arkady meets trader Preem Palver and his wife, who help her flee the planet and take her to their home on Trantor. With Palver\\'s help, Arkady sends a coded message to her father with what she has determined is the location of the Second Foundation. Dr. Darell invents a device which reveals several Second Foundation sleeper agents, and Arkady is tested to make sure she has not been compromised. Dr. Darell is relieved to find that the results are negative, not knowing that the Second Foundation did actually \"adjust\" Arkady shortly after birth, rendering their influence impossible to trace.\\r\\nWimmer and Wilkins described Arkady as \"overconfident and impetuous, but witty and awfully smart for a kid.\" They wrote, \"It\\'s remarkable just how perfectly Asimov captures the occasionally obnoxious precociousness of the gifted teenager ... but he also folds in Arkady\\'s romanticism and femininity without ever making them seem silly or stereotypical.\" Folk-Williams wrote that Arkady \"is introduced with a lot of subtlety as a strong character, but she loses that depth and agency as the story unfolds. Like many others, she only has a moment in the story as she serves the needs of the plan, and then she\\'s gone.\" Donald M. Hassler called Arkady the \"concluding key figure\" of the original Foundation trilogy. Wimmer and Wilkins praised her as \"one of the best characters Asimov ever created\", and one who belonged on \"the short list for science fiction\\'s all-time greatest heroes\". However, they criticized Asimov\\' decision to have Arkady\\'s mind tampered with, describing it as \"callous and cold\", and \"an unnecessarily harsh ending for such a wonderful character.\"\\r\\nArkady is voiced by Sarar Frampton in episode eight \"Star\\'s End\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nBayta and Toran Darell\\r\\nBayta and Toran Darell are a newly married couple in the Foundation and Empire story \"The Mule\". Bayta, a descendant of a great Foundation family, and Toran, who is part of a Trader family, learn that a mysterious figure called the Mule has conquered the barbarian planet Kalgan with no military force and no resistance from the Kalganians. The Darells investigate, but soon leave Kalgan with the fugitive Magnifico, a \"strange, gangly creature\" who is the Mule\\'s former court jester. On Terminus, they seek out elder Foundation scholar Ebling Mis for advice. The complacent Mayor Indbur of Terminus is nonplussed about the danger posed by the Mule, believing that the pending hologram from Hari Seldon will tell them how to handle this latest crisis. Instead, Seldon predicts a civil war between the Foundation and the Traders. The Mule\\'s forces arrive, and Indbur surrenders immediately. The Darells escape with Mis and Magnifico to find the rumored Second Foundation, their only hope to stop the Mule. At what remains of the Great Library of Trantor, Mis works tirelessly to discover clues to the secret location of the Second Foundation. Dying, Mis announces that he knows where the Second Foundation is. Bayta kills him before he can reveal the location, having just realized that Magnifico is the Mule, who seeks the Second Foundation so he can destroy it. He is a mutant who can sense and manipulate the emotions of others, an ability he has employed to conquer planets bloodlessly, and to compel Mis to work himself to death. The Mule promises to find and destroy the Second Foundation, the only threat to his eventual reign over the entire galaxy, but Bayta asserts that it has already prepared for him, and will react before he has time to stop it.\\r\\nJohn Folk-Williams described Bayta as \"the real star of this story, a fairly well realized female character who is considerably smarter and more observant than her young husband and who often carries the burden of explaining what\\'s going on to her less aware companions.\" He noted that the final chapters \"give Bayta the central role in seeing through the Mule\\'s special powers of mind\". Wimmer and Wilkins called Bayta \"a very different type of character from anyone who has previously appeared in Foundation\". They noted that she is only the second female character to appear in any Foundation story, and Folk-Williams deemed Bayta \"one of Asimov\\'s better attempts at a woman character\". Wimmer and Wilkins explained that the Mule subtly controls the emotions of everyone in the story except for Bayta, \"the sole person in the entire galaxy who, of her own volition, treated him like a person ... and that of course was his undoing.\" Noting that the Mule\\'s psychic manipulations \"subtly made Toran Darell far braver and far stupider than he really was\", Wimmer and Wilkins wrote that \"it feels weird to know that a key character like Toran wasn\\'t acting himself throughout most of the story.\"\\r\\nBayta is voiced by Angela Pleasence and Toran by Gary Watson in episode five \"The Mule\" and episode six \"Flight from the Mule\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nIn March 2024, Apple TV+ announced that Synnøve Karlsen and Cody Fern had been cast as Bayta and Toran Mallow for season three of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nEto Demerzel\\r\\nIn Prelude to Foundation, reporter Chetter Hummin warns young mathematician Hari Seldon that his nascent theory of psychohistory has attracted the dangerous attention of Eto Demerzel, the First Minister and chief advisor to Emperor Cleon I. Pairing Seldon with Streeling University historian Dors Venabili, Hummin assists him in his danger-fraught tour of several of Trantor\\'s 800 varied sectors, evading capture by Demerzel while gathering information he hopes will inform if and how psychohistory can be developed into a predictive science. Hummin is revealed to be Demerzel, who has seen the importance of psychohistory to humanity\\'s future and has manipulated Seldon to help him bring it to fruition. Seldon confronts Demerzel with his determination that the First Minister is a robot. Demerzel confirms that he is one of the last surviving robots from the Robot Wars, R. Daneel Olivaw, a prominent character in Asimov\\'s Robot series. He has been guiding human development for centuries, and needs psychohistory to hopefully mitigate the anarchy that will be precipitated by the inevitable and imminent fall of the Empire. Thanks to Demerzel\\'s guidance, Seldon has realized that Trantor itself possesses the diversity and complexity, at a manageable scale, required to build his calculations.:\\u200a213–215\\u200a James E. Gunn compared Seldon\\'s revelation that Demerzel is a robot to the sequence in the 1933 novel Lost Horizon in which Hugh Conway guesses correctly that the High Lama is the 250-year-old monk Perrault.:\\u200a215\\u200a Wimmer and Wilkens described Demerzel as scheming and mysterious, and Hummin as \"impossibly well-connected\", adding \"there\\'s a lot of fun to be had with Hummin and Demerzel\\'s attempts to pass convincingly as humans.\"\\r\\nIn Forward the Foundation, ambitious politician Jo-Jo Joranum schemes to replace Demerzel as First Minister, with the goal of ultimately deposing Cleon I. Realizing the danger, Seldon has his foster son Raych \"reveal\" that Demerzel is a robot. Joranum accuses Demerzel, who seemingly proves himself to not be a robot by laughing, as a human would. A humiliated Joranum is exiled to a distant planet. Demerzel subsequently steps down to focus his efforts elsewhere in the universe, and Cleon appoints Seldon as his First Minister.:\\u200a222\\u200a\\r\\nA gender-swapped and expanded version of the character is portrayed by Laura Birn in the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. This Lady Demerzel is majordomo to the revolving trio of Emperor clones, Brothers Dawn, Day and Dusk. Only the emperors themselves are aware that Demerzel is secretly an ageless robot, the last surviving android from the ancient Robot Wars. Rafael Motamayor of Vulture wrote, \"Demerzel is Foundation\\'s biggest secret weapon—a character the show is mostly keeping a mystery while slowly unraveling just how central to every aspect of the story she really is.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLathan Devers\\r\\nIn the Foundation and Empire story \"The General\", Foundation trader Lathan Devers lets himself be captured by Imperial General Bel Riose to disrupt Riose\\'s overtures against the Foundation from the inside. With Emperor Cleon II\\'s Privy Secretary Ammel Brodrig present to observe Riose, Devers attempts to implicate Riose in a nonexistent attempt to overthrow Cleon. His machinations are exposed, but Ducem Barr helps him escape further interrogation by knocking Riose unconscious and fleeing the planet with Devers in tow. They travel to the Imperial capital planet, Trantor, and plot to influence Cleon directly with Devers\\' invented conspiracy, implicating both Riose and Brodrig. Though they are caught by the Secret Police, they escape and later learn that Riose and Brodrig have been arrested for treason and executed.:\\u200a26\\u200a\\r\\nWimmer and Wilkins wrote of the character, \"Devers clearly wants to be in the mold of the larger-than-life characters we met in Foundation, but he lacks the cunning of a Salvor Hardin or a Hober Mallow. What\\'s worse, Devers is the best the Foundation\\'s got—he\\'s an above-average man living in an era of mediocrity going up against the Empire\\'s last great men.\"\\r\\nDevers is voiced by Michael Harbour in episode four \"The General\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaal Dornick\\r\\nIntroduced in Foundation in the story \"The Psychohistorians\", Gaal Dornick is a gifted young mathematician, newly awarded his doctorate, who has been invited to the Imperial capital planet Trantor from his home planet Synnax by famed mathematician and psychologist Hari Seldon. Seldon has developed the science of psychohistory, which uses sophisticated mathematics and statistical analysis to predict future trends on a galactic scale. Knowing that Dornick is possibly the only person in the galaxy capable of fully understanding his work, Seldon reveals his prediction of the unavoidable and relatively imminent fall of the Galactic Empire. He has conceived a plan, in which Dornick\\'s participation is crucial, to mitigate the duration of this societal collapse. Under surveillance by agents of the Committee of Public Safety since his arrival, Dornick is arrested and interrogated. As orchestrated by Seldon, he and his followers are exiled to the distant planet Terminus, where he intends to execute this plan by establishing the Foundation.:\\u200a23–24\\u200a Describing \"The Psychohistorians\" as \"28 pages of nonstop world-building\", Wimmer and Wilkins note that \"the ostensible protagonist, Gaal Dornick, is such a non-entity that he barely even counts as an audience identification figure\".\\r\\nDornick is voiced by Geoffrey Beevers in episode one \"Psychohistory and Encyclopedia\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nA gender-swapped and expanded version of Dornick is portrayed by Lou Llobell in the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. She is a mathematical prodigy from an ocean world where science and mathematics are considered heresy, and forbidden.\\r\\n\\r\\nSalvor Hardin\\r\\nIntroduced in Foundation in the story \"The Encyclopedists\", Salvor Hardin is the first mayor of Terminus City, the primary settlement on Terminus. Hardin believes Terminus is in danger of political exploitation by the four neighboring prefectures of the Empire. Identifying the kingdom of Anacreon as the most powerful of the four, Hardin visits the others and convinces them that they must resist nuclear power from falling to Anacreon alone. The three issue a joint ultimatum that all be allowed to receive nuclear technology from Terminus City, ensuring that the Foundation is indispensable to all.:\\u200a24–25\\u200a\\r\\nIn \"The Mayors\", Anacreon launches a direct military assault against Terminus using an abandoned Imperial battlecruiser. Hardin secretly installs a kill switch into the cruiser, causing the crew to mutiny. Maddened by this failure, Prince Regent Wienis of Anacreon orders Hardin\\'s execution, but his royal guardsmen refuse to obey him. He then attempts, but fails, to kill Hardin himself.:\\u200a24–25\\u200a\\r\\nHardin is voiced by Lee Montague in episode two \"The Mayors\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nA gender-swapped version of Hardin is portrayed by Leah Harvey in the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. She is the Warden and protector of Terminus, 35 years after Seldon\\'s trial.\\r\\n\\r\\nHober Mallow\\r\\nIntroduced in Foundation in the story \"The Merchant Princes\", Hober Mallow is a Master Trader for the Foundation. He and his ship, Far Star, are sent to Korell to investigate the disappearance of three Foundation vessels in the vicinity. A Foundation missionary, Reverend Jord Parma, seeks sanctuary, but Mallow suspects subterfuge and turns Parma over to the Korellians, whose laws forbid Foundation missionaries to be on the planet under penalty of death. Mallow negotiates the sale of Foundation devices to the ruler of Korell, and soon the planet is dependent on them. Mallow is later tried for murder on Terminus for condemning the missionary to death, but is exonerated when he proves that Parma was actually an agent of the Korellian secret police. Mallow\\'s popularity results in his appointment to Mayor of Terminus. Korell subsequently declares war on the Foundation, and when Mallow imposes an embargo on them, the Korellan economy collapses due to its dependency on Foundation technology, thus forcing its surrender.:\\u200a25–26\\u200a Wimmer and Wilkins described Mallow as \"larger-than-life\", and \"one of the strangest characters Asimov ever created, a heartless bastard who\\'s described physically more like a particularly intelligent shaved bear than a normal human.\"\\r\\nMallow is voiced by Julian Glover as in episode three \"The Merchant Princes\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nMallow is portrayed by Dimitri Leonidas in season two of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. He is a roguish trader and con man  with a \"sarcastic personality and questionable morals, who is summoned against his will to serve a higher, selfless cause.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEbling Mis\\r\\nIn the Foundation and Empire story \"The Mule\", Ebling Mis is the Foundation\\'s first real psychologist since its founding. He is warned by Bayta and Toran Darell about the Mule, a mysterious figure who has conquered the planet Kalgan and is planning to do the same to other worlds. Mis tries to warn Mayor Indbur of Terminus of the danger posed by the Mule, but is rebuffed. The Foundation soon falls to the Mule, and Mis flees with the Darells and Magnifico, the Mule\\'s former jester, to find the rumored Second Foundation and seek their aid. At what remains of the Great Library of Trantor, Mis works tirelessly to discover clues to the secret location of the Second Foundation. Dying, Mis announces that he knows where the Second Foundation is. Bayta kills him before he can reveal the location, having just realized that Magnifico is the Mule, who seeks the Second Foundation so he can destroy it. He is a mutant who can sense and manipulate the emotions of others, an ability he has employed to conquer planets bloodlessly, and to compel Mis to work himself to death. The Mule promises to find and destroy the Second Foundation, the only threat to his eventual reign over the entire galaxy.\\r\\nWimmer and Wilkins called Mis \"the liveliest character of the series since Salvor Hardin\", and described him as \"so deliberately over-the-top—and so fun to read because of it ... he\\'s like one of Heinlein\\'s classic old men, Jubal Harshaw or Lazarus Long, with a heaping dash of comic outrageousness that wouldn\\'t work in Stranger in a Strange Land or Time Enough for Love (they\\'re too ponderous) but fits perfectly in the slightly cartoonish universe of the Foundation.\" They also remarked on the \"brutality\" of the \"compulsive gradual suicide\" visited upon Mis by the Mule, and called the character\\'s death at Bayta\\'s hands \"a horrifying moment\". Wimmer and Wilkins wrote that \"Mis is on the verge of unwittingly selling out everything he\\'s ever lived for, forcing a dear and innocent friend to destroy him\". They argued, \"[Mis\\'s] death really does signal the end of the Foundation as we have come to know it. Up till that moment, things have still felt a bit like a game ... the Mule might have taken over Terminus and Haven, but there\\'s little sense of any enormous casualties. You feel like, heck, maybe even if he did win, things wouldn\\'t be so awful ... and then Mis is gone, and in a manner as ugly and unhappy as anyone could imagine ... it hits home just how awful things are, just how terribly the Mule has disturbed the order of things.\"\\r\\nMis is voiced by Maurice Denham in episode five \"The Mule\" and episode six \"Flight from the Mule\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nMis will be portrayed by Alexander Siddig in season three of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. The character is described as a \"self-taught psychohistorian and diehard fan of Hari Seldon.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Mule\\r\\nIn the Foundation and Empire story \"The Mule\", a mysterious figure called the Mule has conquered the planet Kalgan with no military force and no resistance from the Kalganians. Foundation-aligned newlyweds Bayta and Toran Darell leave Kalgan with the Mule\\'s fugitive court jester, Magnifico Giganticus, and soon the Foundation falls to the Mule as well. The Darells and elder Foundation scholar Ebling Mis escape with Magnifico to find the rumored Second Foundation, their only hope to stop the Mule. After tireless research, a dying Mis announces that he knows where the Second Foundation is. Bayta kills him before he can reveal the location, having just realized that Magnifico is the Mule, who seeks the Second Foundation so he can destroy it. He is a mutant who can sense and manipulate the emotions of others, an ability he has employed to conquer planets bloodlessly, to \"Convert\" Foundation intelligence officer Han Pritcher into a loyal agent, and to compel Mis to work himself to death. The Mule promises to find and destroy the Second Foundation, the only threat to his eventual reign over the entire galaxy.\\r\\nThe Second Foundation story \"Part I: Search by the Mule\" finds the Mule still searching for the elusive Second Foundation. Pritcher is accompanied on his latest search by Bail Channis, a follower of the Mule who remains \"Unconverted\" by the Mule\\'s psychic powers and who the Mule suspects is a Second Foundation agent. Pritcher deduces that Channis is a spy, but Channis possesses a psychic ability similar to the Mule\\'s and uses it to free Pritcher from the Mule\\'s control. The Mule appears and uses mental torture to extract the true location of the Second Foundation from Channis\\'s mind, but the First Speaker of the Second Foundation arrives and informs the Mule that he has been defeated. While the Mule has been focused on Channis, Second Foundation agents have traveled to Kalgan and the Foundation worlds to undo the Mule\\'s Conversions and orchestrate an insurrection, and his fleet is too far away to prevent it. When the Mule experiences a moment of despair, the First Speaker is able to seize control of and alter his mind: he will return to Kalgan and live out the rest of his life as a peaceful despot.\\r\\nMagnifico/The Mule is voiced by Wolfe Morris in episodes five, six and seven of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nThe Mule is portrayed by Mikael Persbrandt in season two of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. Decider called the introduction of the Mule \"one of the show\\'s most long-awaited moments\". The role was recast with Pilou Asbæk for season three. Additionally, Magnifico will be portrayed by Tómas Lemarquis.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreem Palver\\r\\nIn the Second Foundation story \"Part II: Search by the Foundation\", farmer and trader Preem Palver and his wife are at the spaceport on Kalgan when they meet teenager Arkady Darell. Arkady is fleeing Lord Stettin, the warlord of Kalgan, so the Palvers take her with them to their home on Trantor. Palver later helps Arkady send a coded message to her father, Dr. Toran Darell II of the Foundation, containing what she believes is the location of the Second Foundation. Stettin launches an invasion of the Foundation which fails, and the discovery of several Second Foundation sleeper agents convinces the Foundation that they have eliminated the threat of the Second Foundation. Palver, however, is secretly the First Speaker of the intact Second Foundation, and has orchestrated Stettin\\'s attack, its failure, the discovery of Palver\\'s own agents and even Arkady\\'s participation to convince the Foundation that they have triumphed.\\r\\nPalver is voiced by Cyril Shaps in episode seven \"The Mule Finds\" and episode eight \"Star\\'s End\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nPalver will be portrayed by Troy Kotsur in season three of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. The character is described as \"the leader of a planet of psychics.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLewis Pirenne\\r\\nIntroduced in Foundation in the story \"The Encyclopedists\", Dr. Lewis Pirenne is the chairman of the Foundation\\'s Board of Trustees and the leader of the Encyclopedists. He dismisses Mayor Salvor Hardin\\'s concerns about the Foundation\\'s susceptibility to interference by nearby regimes, believing that their focus should be on creating the Encyclopedia Galactica and not local politics. When Hari Seldon\\'s Time Vault opens and Seldon reveals that the encyclopedia was merely an excuse to establish the Foundation away from Imperial control, Pirenne realizes that he was wrong and cedes leadership of the Foundation to Hardin.\\r\\nBook Analysis and Shmoop explained that Pirenne is rigid and resistant to change, which is ultimately in conflict with Seldon\\'s Plan. Wimmer and Wilkins described Pirenne as a \"useless twit\".\\r\\nPirenne is voiced by Roy Spencer in episode one \"Psychohistory and Encyclopedia\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nPirenne is portrayed by Elliot Cowan in season one of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. He is the Director of the Foundation and first successor of Hari Seldon, and comes into conflict with Salvor Hardin over how to handle the arrival of the Anacreons to Terminus.\\r\\n\\r\\nHan Pritcher\\r\\nIn the Foundation and Empire story \"The Mule\", Han Pritcher is a Foundation intelligence officer and secretly a member of the Democratic Underground on Terminus, planning to overthrow Mayor Indbur. Though ordered by the Mayor to investigate renegade traders, he instead looks into the sudden takeover of the planet Kalgan by the Mule. Pritcher attempts to assassinate the Mule in a suicide attack to thwart his conquest of the Foundation, but the Mule is a mutant and uses his psychic powers to \"Convert\" Pritcher into one of his most loyal followers.\\r\\nIn the Second Foundation story \"Part I: Search by the Mule\", the Mule has yet to find the elusive Second Foundation. He sends Pritcher on his sixth search, this time accompanied by Bail Channis, the only one of the Mule\\'s followers who is \"Unconverted\", or not influenced by the Mule\\'s psychic powers to serve him. The Mule tells Pritcher this will be an advantage to their quest, but he actually believes that Channis is a Second Foundation agent who intends to lead the Mule into a trap. Secretly followed by the Mule and his fleet, Channis leads the search to the desolate planet Tazenda. Pritcher draws his atomic blaster on Channis, who he now suspects to be an agent of the Second Foundation. Pritcher is correct, but Channis possesses a psychic ability similar to the Mule\\'s and uses it to free Pritcher from the Mule\\'s control. The Mule appears, but while he has been focused on Channis, the Second Foundation has orchestrated an insurrection on Kalgan, and his fleet is too far away to prevent it. When the Mule experiences a moment of despair, the First Speaker of the Second Foundation is able to seize control of and alter his mind: he will return to Kalgan and live out the rest of his life as a peaceful despot. Pritcher joins him.\\r\\nWimmer and Wilkins wrote of Pritcher, \"He breaks rules without a second thought ... but his code of honor forces him to be as honest about it as he possibly can. Before defying his orders, he tries to work through the appropriate official channels, even though he knows it\\'s futile.\" They describe Pritcher\\'s final Conversion by the Mule as \"crushing\", writing that \"more than any other character in this story, Pritcher was an individual, and it\\'s so sad to see him reduced to a puppet of the Mule, albeit still a charming and unconventional one.\" Wimmer and Wilkins wrote that the Converted version of the character in \"Search by the Mule\" is \"a tricky protagonist to really connect with\" due to \"a lot of second derivative characterization\".\\r\\nPritcher is voiced by John Justin in episodes five, six and seven of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nPritcher will be portrayed by Brandon P. Bell in season three of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nBel Riose\\r\\nIn the Foundation and Empire story \"The General\", Imperial General Bel Riose governs the planet Siwenna. He investigates the Foundation and is soon determined to destroy it, both as a perceived threat to the Empire and to further his own ambitions. Foundation trader Lathan Devers lets himself be captured by Riose to disrupt his overtures against the Foundation from the inside. With Emperor Cleon II\\'s Privy Secretary Ammel Brodrig present to observe Riose, Devers attempts to implicate Riose in a nonexistent attempt to overthrow Cleon. His machinations are exposed, but Ducem Barr, a Foundation sympathizer forced to aid Riose, helps him escape further interrogation by knocking Riose unconscious and fleeing the planet with Devers in tow. They travel to the Imperial capital planet, Trantor, and plot to influence Cleon directly with Devers\\' invented conspiracy, implicating both Riose and Brodrig. Though they are caught by the Secret Police, they escape and later learn that Riose and Brodrig have been arrested for treason and executed. Asimov later explains the political dynamics of why Riose would never have been able to defeat the Foundation: a strong emperor\\'s sense of self-preservation would never allow him to tolerate a subordinate who develops potentially threatening power.:\\u200a26\\u200a Riose is loosely based on Belisarius, a great general of the Roman Empire who served Justinian I during the 6th century AD.:\\u200a56–57\\u200a\\r\\nRiose is voiced by Dinsdale Landen in episode four \"The General\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nRiose is portrayed by Ben Daniels in season two of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. He is the last great general of the Superliminal Fleet, imprisoned by Emperor Cleon for breaking orders to save troops, despite still achieving a victory. In exchange for his freedom and a reunion with his husband, Glawen Curr, Riose agrees to investigate the dissident Foundation on behalf of the Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\nHari Seldon\\r\\nIntroduced in Foundation in \"The Psychohistorians\", famed mathematician and psychologist Hari Seldon has developed the science of psychohistory, which uses sophisticated mathematics and statistical analysis to predict future trends on a galactic scale. He has predicted the unavoidable and relatively imminent fall of the Galactic Empire, which will spark a Dark Age lasting 30,000 years. Seldon has conceived a plan which, by his calculations, will limit this interregnum to 1,000 years. He orchestrates his own trial by the Commission of Public Safety, the ruling body of the Empire, who are displeased with his predictions and the potential chaos they would incite. As Seldon anticipated, the Commission does not want to martyr him, so he and his 100,000 followers are exiled from Trantor, the center of the Empire, to the distant and nearly inhospitable planet Terminus. There Seldon intends to establish the Foundation, \"a repository of crucial, civilization-preserving knowledge\" that will enable society to revive itself more quickly and efficiently.:\\u200a23–24\\u200a Describing the \"The Psychohistorians\" as \"28 pages of nonstop world-building\", Wimmer and Wilkins wrote that in the story, \"Hari Seldon isn\\'t so much a character as he is the living embodiment of psychohistory, an ethereal presence who\\'s about as relatable as Gandalf. It wouldn\\'t be until Prelude to Foundation ... that Seldon would become an actual character.\"\\r\\nSeldon is voiced by William Eedle in several episodes of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nSeldon is portrayed by Jared Harris in the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nDors Venabili\\r\\nIn Prelude to Foundation, reporter Chetter Hummin introduces young mathematician Hari Seldon to Streeling University historian Dors Venabili, who subsequently joins Seldon in his danger-fraught tour of several of Trantor\\'s 800 varied sectors. Seldon is gathering information he hopes will inform if and how his nascent theory of psychohistory can be developed into a predictive science. He realizes that Trantor itself possesses the diversity and complexity, at a manageable scale, required to build his calculations. But he also requires the emotional support of Venabili, and does not care that she may also be a robot.:\\u200a213–215\\u200a In Forward the Foundation, Seldon and Venabili have married, and adopted the former street urchin Raych. But their relationship is strained, and they continue to grow apart. Venabili begins an investigation centered on the Electro-Clarifier, a new device co-invented by Tamwile Elar and built by Cinda Moray, which enhances the abilities of Seldon\\'s Prime Radiant. Venabili believes the Electro-Clarifier is aging Seldon and Yugo Amaryl prematurely, but instead she discovers it is actually killing her, because it only affects the positronic brains of robots.:\\u200a222–223\\u200a She finally admits to Seldon that she is a robot, and having killed Elar to protect him, reveals that the combination of the device\\'s effects and breaking the First Law of Robotics by harming a human has caused irreparable damage. Dying, she tells Seldon that his love made her human.:\\u200a222–223\\u200a\\r\\nWimmer and Wilkins wrote that though Venabili\\'s death delivered \"a genuine sense of tragedy ... Dors was a hard character to get a fix on—there was always a faint coldness about her\".\\r\\n\\r\\nPoly Verisof\\r\\nIntroduced in Foundation in the story \"The Mayors\", Poly Verisof is the Foundation ambassador and High Priest on Anacreon. After Salvor Hardin discovers a plot against him orchestrated by Prince Regent Wienis, he employs the aid of Verisof, who uses his mass following to instigate a mob against Wienis that helps assure Hardin\\'s victory.\\r\\nWimmer and Wilkins wrote that though Verisof does not believe in the religious culture established on Anacreon, he does not \"think any less of the believers or wish them any harm\" and recognizes religion as \"the best way of doing some good at a time when science has become tainted with the Empire\\'s failure.\"\\r\\nVerisof is voiced by William Fox in episode two \"The Mayors\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nVerisof is portrayed by Kulvinder Ghir in season two of the 2021 TV series adaptation Foundation. He is High Claric of the Foundation\\'s propagandist Church of the Galactic Spirit. Verisof, who was a child at the dawn of the Foundation, is Brother Constant\\'s superior and companion. He is described as \"Whip-smart and sardonic, he\\'s also a terrible drunk — intelligent enough to see the path he\\'s on, but too cynical to change. The character is portrayed as child by Jairaj Varsani in season one, and the season two episode \"Where the Stars Are Scattered Thinly\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers from the novels\\r\\nYugo Amaryl is a trusted colleague of Hari Seldon who works closely with him on the development of psychohistory. In Prelude to Foundation, Hari Seldon meets Amaryl, a menial worker in the heatsinks of the Dahl sector of Trantor, where vast subterranean operations generate energy from heat in the deep recesses of the planet. Seldon and Dors Venabili are on a danger-fraught tour of several of Trantor\\'s 800 varied sectors, evading capture by First Minister Eto Demerzel while gathering information Seldon hopes will inform if and how psychohistory can be developed into a predictive science. Amaryl reveals himself to be a mathematical prodigy, and once Seldon is safe he arranges for Amaryl to begin studies at Streeling University.:\\u200a214\\u200a In Forward the Foundation, Amaryl has earned a doctorate and is Seldon\\'s closest and most trusted colleague, working with him on the development of psychohistory. Seldon\\'s 12-year-old granddaughter Wanda finds an error in one of the equations generated by Amaryl\\'s Prime Radiant. Amaryl soon realizes that she is not a mathematical prodigy, but instead possesses nascent mentalic ability which she unknowingly used to read his mind and pick up on his subconscious sense that the formula was wrong. Seldon and a dying Amaryl revive their idea of developing two foundations that would serve as the beginnings of a new Galactic Empire. The First Foundation would be a group of scholars tasked with creating the Encyclopedia Galactica to preserve the sum of human knowledge, and to be a haven for technological advance, which psychohistory predicts would decrease the recovery time to form a second Galactic Empire. The Second Foundation would be a group of Mentalics, acting as guardians of the psychohistorical track by \"introducing fine adjustments\" influencing historical events.:\\u200a221–224\\u200a\\r\\nPelleas Anthor is a new member of the Foundation cabal looking for the location of the Second Foundation in the Second Foundation story  \"Part II: Search by the Foundation\". He shares his belief that the second Foundation is on Kalgan. Dr. Toran Darell II invents an electronic \"Mind Static\" device which disrupts Second Foundation mental influence and can be fatal to its agents. It reveals that Anthor and some others are Second Foundation sleeper agents. Dr. Darell and the Foundation are left believing they have eliminated the Second Foundation, when in fact the entire situation has been orchestrated by the intact Second Foundation for just that purpose. Anthor is voiced by Gabriel Woolf in episode eight \"Star\\'s End\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nAmmel Brodrig is Emperor Cleon II\\'s Privy Secretary in the Foundation and Empire story \"The General\". He is sent to Siwenna to observe General Bel Riose, who has mounted an offensive against the Foundation in Cleon\\'s name. Though Brodrig is not fooled by Lathan Devers\\' attempt to implicate Riose in a nonexistent coup, Devers and Ducem Barr push the false conspiracy again on Trantor, and this time Riose and Brodrig are arrested for treason and executed.:\\u200a26\\u200a Nicolas David Gevers saw Brodrig as based on Narses, an important member of the court of Byzantine emperor Justinian I, \"who dogged Belisarius\"—the model for Bel Riose—\"and ultimately replaced him as general\".:\\u200a57\\u200a Brodrig is voiced by Martin Friend in episode four \"The General\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nLady Callia is the flighty consort of Lord Stettin, the ruler of Kalgan, in the Second Foundation story  \"Part II: Search by the Foundation\". Arkady Darell manipulates Callia to persuade Stettin to allow librarian Homir Munn, secretly an agent of the Foundation, access to the Mule\\'s palace for research purposes. Munn is searching for clues to the location of the elusive Second Foundation. When Stettin holds Munn hostage as part of his offensive against the Foundation, Callia helps Arkady escape. Only in their final moments together does Arkady realize that Callia is a shrewd agent of the Second Foundation who has been subtly manipulating events on Kalgan. Wimmer and Wilkins wrote \"In the case of Lady Callia, Asimov seems to get inside her own head quite a bit without ever hinting at her true nature, and so the misdirect seems more than a little unfair. I suppose one could argue Asimov is making the point that a Second Foundation agent\\'s disguise is so absolute that even the omniscient narrator cannot pierce the truth ... but that seems pretty weak\". Callia is voiced by Prunella Scales in episode eight \"Star\\'s End\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nLinge Chen is the corrupt Commissioner of Public Safety introduced in Foundation in the story \"The Psychohistorians\". When presented with the argument that Hari Seldon\\'s psychohistory is a means to save humanity\\'s future, Chen comments that this is of no concern to men and women who will all be dead in fifty years\\' time. Wimmer and Wilkins called Chen \"the most memorable character\" in the story, \"mostly because of his impressive silence.\"\\r\\nToran Darell II is the scientist son of Bayta and Toran Darell in the Second Foundation story  \"Part II: Search by the Foundation\". He is part of a cabal within the Foundation which has been alerted to the galactic manipulations of the Second Foundation and its Metalics, and sees them as a threat to their own efforts toward Seldon\\'s Plan. Dr. Darell invents an electronic \"Mind Static\" device which disrupts Second Foundation mental influence and can be fatal to its agents. Discovering several Second Foundation sleeper agents, he tests Arkady to make sure she has not been compromised. Dr. Darell is relieved to find that the results are negative, not knowing that the Second Foundation did actually \"adjust\" Arkady shortly after birth, rendering their influence impossible to trace. Dr. Darell and the Foundation are left believing they have eliminated the Second Foundation, when in fact the entire situation has been orchestrated by the intact Second Foundation for just that purpose. Wimmer and Wilkins argued that Dr. Darell\\'s hostility toward the Second Foundation does not entirely make sense considering his devotion to Seldon\\'s Plan, but is justified by his objection to the Second Foundation\\'s ability to oppress the population by what is effectively mind control. They compared Dr. Darell to Salvor Hardin in that \"he is trying to defeat an enemy against whom he is seemingly completely unmatched with only the dimmest awareness of how he can even fight the battle\", and wrote that he is depicted as \"every bit the romantic his daughter Arkady is, even if his romanticism has become wrapped up in careful plotting, endless psychology, and cutting-edge neuroscience.\" Dr. Darell is voiced by Carleton Hobbs in episode eight \"Star\\'s End\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nLord Dorwin is an Imperial emissary sent to mediate the negotiations Between the Foundation and Anacreon in Foundation in the story \"The Encyclopedists\". Dorwin\\'s commentary on the Empire inadvertently illustrates its decline to Salvor Hardin. Further, Dorwin\\'s contradictory arguments render his peace treaty meaningless. Wimmer and Wilkins described Dorwin as \"pretty hilarious.\" Darwin is voiced by Ronald Herdman in episode one \"Psychohistory and Encyclopedia\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nManella Dubanqua is a prostitute who acts as an informant for Gambol Deen Namarti, who is plotting against Hari Seldon in Forward the Foundation. Raych Seldon infiltrates Namarti\\'s group and becomes involved with Dubanqua. Recognizing him as Seldon\\'s son, Namarti drugs Raych to assassinate Seldon, but Raych is stopped by Dubanqua, secretly a security agent. Raych and Dubanqua marry hand have two daughters, Wanda and Bellis.:\\u200a222\\u200a\\r\\nIndbur is the hereditary Mayor of Terminus in the Foundation and Empire story \"The Mule\". He is \"a weak bureaucrat who relies on strict procedure and tolerates no deviance from his orders.\" The complacent Mayor Indbur is nonplussed about the danger posed by the Mule, believing that the pending hologram from Hari Seldon will tell them how to handle this latest crisis. Instead, Seldon predicts a civil war between the Foundation and the Traders. The Mule\\'s forces arrive, and Indbur surrenders immediately. It is later revealed that the Mule is able to conquer planets bloodlessly because he is a mutant who can sense and manipulate the emotions of others. Indbur is voiced by John Ruddock in episode five \"The Mule\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy. Indbur will be portrayed by Leo Bill in season three of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation.\\r\\nJerril is an agent for the Commission of Public Safety in Foundation in the story \"The Psychohistorians\". He spies on Gaal during his trip to the observatory and confirms that Gaal is working with Seldon. Jerril is portrayed  by Reece Shearsmith in the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. In \"The Emperor\\'s Peace\", he is an Imperial agent who allows Gaal Dornick to examine the Prime Radiant so that she may discredit Hari Seldon\\'s dire calculations.\\r\\nLaskin \"Jo-Jo\" Joranum is an ambitious politician in Forward the Foundation who schemes to replace Eto Demerzel as Cleon I\\'s First Minister, with the goal of ultimately deposing the emperor himself. Realizing the danger, Hari Seldon has his foster son Raych \"reveal\" that Demerzel is a robot. Joranum accuses Demerzel, who seemingly proves himself to not be a robot by laughing, as a human would. A humiliated Joranum is exiled to a distant planet.:\\u200a222\\u200a\\r\\nYohan Lee is Salvor Hardin\\'s chief advisor and friend in the Foundation story \"The Encyclopedists\" who assists him in overthrowing the ruling board of Terminus City. Lee is voiced by John Hollis in episode one \"Psychohistory and Encyclopedia\" and episode two \"The Mayors\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nHomir Munn is an agent of the Foundation in the Second Foundation story \"Part II: Search by the Foundation\". He is part of a cabal within the Foundation which has been alerted to the galactic manipulations of the Second Foundation and its Metalics, and sees them as a threat to their own efforts toward Seldon\\'s Plan. Munn is sent to Kalgan to search for clues to the Second Foundation\\'s location, and is followed by teenager Arkady Darell. Munn is rebuffed by Lord Stettin, the current warlord of Kalgan, but Arkady manipulates his flighty consort, Lady Callia, to persuade Stettin to allow librarian Munn access to the Mule\\'s palace for research purposes. Stettin becomes suspicious that his court might have been infiltrated by the Second Foundation, and arrests Munn. After Stettin\\'s invasion of the Foundation on Terminus fails, Munn believes the Second Foundation never existed. He is proven incorrect when several Second Foundation sleeper agents are discovered. Munn is voiced by David March in episode eight \"Star\\'s End\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nGambol Deen Namarti is an associate of Jo-Jo Joranum who plots to supplant Hari Seldon as Cleon I\\'s First Minister after Joranum\\'s exile in Forward the Foundation. He attempts to assassinate Seldon by drugging his foster son Raych, but the plan is foiled at the last moment by undercover security officer Manella Dubanqua.:\\u200a222\\u200a\\r\\nLimmar Ponyets is a Master Trader of the Foundation introduced in Foundation in the story \"The Traders\". He negotiates with the Elders of the planet Askone to secure the release of Eskel Gorov, another Foundation trader of nuclear weapons who has been imprisoned and sentenced to death due to traditional taboos that effectively ban advanced technology. Ponyets manipulates the Elders using their religious beliefs and a transmuter that will convert iron into gold. Wimmer and Wilkins called Ponyets \"the least interesting of all the Foundation protagonists\", but wrote that he and Salvor Hardin \"let the bad guys accumulate all this power, and then ever so deftly turn it back against them.\" They also described Ponyets\\'s blackmail of an ambitious politician as \"lame\" compared to \"the operatic scope of Hardin\\'s secret plan in \\'The Mayors\\'.\"\\r\\nRaych Seldon is a street urchin in the slums of Billibotton whom Hari Seldon and Dors Venabili meet as they traverse Trantor in Prelude to Foundation.:\\u200a214–215\\u200a In Forward the Foundation, Seldon determines that populist Jo-Jo Joranum is scheming to replace Eto Demerzel as Cleon I\\'s First Minister and then overthrow the emperor. Seldon has Raych, now his foster son, \"reveal\" that Demerzel is a robot. Joranum confronts Demerzel publicly, and is ruined when Demerzel seemingly proves himself to not be a robot by laughing, as a human would. Years later, Joranum\\'s associate Gambol Deen Namarti plots against Seldon. Raych infiltrates Namarti\\'s group and becomes involved with a prostitute named Manella Dubanqua. Recognizing him as Seldon\\'s son, Namarti drugs Raych, who is stopped from assassinating Seldon himself by Dubanqua, secretly a security agent. Raych and Dubanqua marry hand have two daughters, Wanda and Bellis.:\\u200a222\\u200a Raych emigrates from Trantor to the planet Santanni, and is killed fighting anti-Imperial rebels.:\\u200a223\\u200a\\r\\nWanda Seldon is the daughter of Raych Seldon and Manella Dubanqua. In Forward the Foundation, 12-year-old Wanda finds an error in one of the equations generated by Yugo Amaryl\\'s Prime Radiant. Amaryl soon realizes that she is not a mathematical prodigy, but instead possesses nascent mentalic ability which she unknowingly used to read his mind and pick up on his subconscious sense that the formula was wrong. This leads to a revival of Seldon and Amaryl\\'s plan to create a Second Foundation made up of Mentalics.:\\u200a221–224\\u200a\\r\\nSef Sermak is a political rival to Salvor Hardin, introduced in Foundation in the story \"The Mayors\". Sermak\\'s Actionist party proposes that the Foundation takes direct action against Anacreon and the three other local kingdoms instead of Hardin\\'s subtle method of technology trade and scientism. After Hardin\\'s methods save the Foundation from the crisis, Sermak concedes that Hardin was correct all along. Years after Hardin relinquishes power as mayor, Sermak succeeds him. Sermak is voiced by John Samson in episode two \"The Mayors\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy. Sermak is portrayed by Oliver Chris in season two of the 2021 television series adaptation Foundation. Director Sermak is the leader of the Foundation, and he and his husband Pater are the fathers of Brother Constant.\\r\\nLord Stettin is the First Citizen and ruler of Kalgan, 55 years after the Mule\\'s death of natural causes, in the Second Foundation story  \"Part II: Search by the Foundation\". He believes that the Mule\\'s actions have made the Seldon Plan irrelevant, and declares war upon the Foundation. Stettin intends to usurp their role in the formation of the Second Empire, and is unconcerned by the possible intervention of the Second Foundation. He prepares a full-scale invasion of the original Foundation on Terminus, but is handily defeated, in part because the Second Foundation has used their psychic abilities to reduce the morale of his troops while boosting the Foundation\\'s. It is also later revealed that Lady Callia is a Second Foundation agent who manipulated Stettin into declaring war so that he would lose. Stettin is voiced by Peter Pratt in episode eight \"Star\\'s End\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\nJorane Sutt is the secretary to the Mayor of Terminus in the Foundation story \"The Merchant Princes\". As the real power behind the Mayor, he is threatened by the rising political power of Master Trader Hober Mallow. Sutt sends Mallow on an investigative mission accompanied by his spy, Jaim Twer, and later has him tried for murder. When Mallow is exonerated and named Mayor, he arrests Sutt and his accomplices.:\\u200a25–26\\u200a Wimmer and Wilkins described \"scheming Terminus politico\" Sutt\\'s plan as \"is subtly worse than anything we\\'ve seen before—he wants to turn the science-based clergy against the Foundation, leading the combined might of the Four Kingdoms against all his enemies on Terminus, and then in turn he will start conquering the rest of the galaxy ... he\\'s actually trying to pervert the Seldon Plan to his own ends.\" Sutt is voiced by Anthony Jackson in episode three \"The Merchant Princes\" of the 1973 radio adaptation The Foundation Trilogy.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroduced in the TV series\\r\\nThe 2021 Apple TV+ television series adaptation Foundation invents several characters who do not appear in Asimov\\'s series of novels.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrother Constant\\r\\nBrother Constant is a claric of the Foundation\\'s propagandist Church of the Galactic Spirit, portrayed by Isabella Laughland in season two. Described as \"cheerfully confident\", she is a \"true believer\" in Seldon\\'s Plan whose job is to extol its virtues and \"whose courage and passion make her hard not to love.\" Introduced in the 2023 episode \"A Glimpse of Darkness\", Constant is also the daughter of Foundation Director Sef Sermak and his husband Pater. In \"King and Commoner\", she and her superior, High Claric Poly Verisof, escape capture on Korell with trader and con man Hober Mallow. Hari Seldon tasks Constant and Poly to begin peace talks with the Empire in \"Where the Stars are Scattered Thinly\". They are promptly arrested when attempting to do so on Trantor in \"Why the Gods Made Wine\". In \"The Last Empress\", Mallow saves Constant from execution by the Empire, and they consummate their relationship. In the season two finale \"Creation Myths\", Mallow puts Constant in the only remaining escape pod of the doomed Imperial flagship Shining Destiny, and sends her to safety as he and General Bel Riose sacrifice themselves on the exploding ship.\\r\\nJeffrey Speicher of Collider wrote that Constant\\'s \"straightforward, shoot-from-the-hip manner is one of the most fun and refreshing aspects of a mind-bending show that can sometimes feel a little overwhelming with the pure size and scope of the stories it takes on.\" Julia Glassman of The Mary Sue described Constant as \"one of the funniest and most relatable figures in the series\" and \"a thoroughly funny, lovable character\", and calling her \"the queen of deadpan gags.\" Richard Edwards of Space.com described the character as having \"charm to spare\". Sean T. Collins of Decider praised Constant\\'s \"forthrightness and directness\" in propositioning Mallow, and Speicher agreed that her \"straightforward and refreshing approach to expressing her feelings for Hober brings a natural and organic dynamic to [their] romantic storyline.\" Speicher described the relationship between Constant and Mallow as \"the best romantic relationship in Foundation so far.\" Collins appreciated that \"Constant is attracted to, not repulsed by, Hober\\'s swagger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nGlawen Curr\\r\\nGlawen Curr is the husband and second-in-command to General Bel Riose, portrayed by Dino Fetscher in season two. In the 2023 episode \"King and Commoner\", disgraced Riose is freed from imprisonment at the Lepsis penal colony and reunited with Curr, both men having been previously told that the other was executed. Restored to his position as Fleet Supremus, Curr joins Riose in his investigation of the dissident Foundation on behalf of the Empire. In \"Where the Stars are Scattered Thinly\", Riose and Curr visit Imperial informant Ducem Barr on Siwenna and learn that the Foundation, and by extension their propagandists the Church of the Galactic Spirit, possess forbidden technology. Riose and Curr debate their options for turning against Empire in \"A Necessary Death\", but Riose ultimately declares any such action to be too great a risk. The Imperial fleet faces off against the Foundation in \"Long Ago, Not Far Away\", and Riose believes he can end the conflict without violence. But the Emperor clone Brother Day, baited by Hari Seldon, orders Riose to crash the Invictus, an ancient Imperial warship commandeered by the Foundation, into Terminus to devastate the planet and destroy the Foundation. Riose reluctantly does so, even though he knows Curr is on the surface. A scheme orchestrated by Seldon destroys the Imperial fleet in the season two finale \"Creation Myths\". Riose kills Day, but is trapped on his doomed flagship and dies in its destruction. Meanwhile, Curr and the population of Terminus have escaped the planet\\'s destruction via Seldon\\'s Vault.\\r\\nGary Grimes of Attitude described the emotional reunion of Riose and Curr as \"a cornerstone moment in the high-octane series.\" The series depicts their homosexuality as a non-issue. Fetscher said, \"It was so refreshing that our characters\\' sexualities were just incidental ... In this world, sexuality is very different. It\\'s just the same as you have blue eyes and I have brown eyes. In lots of ways, it\\'s really inspiring because it\\'s not so far in the future.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRaych Foss\\r\\nRaych Foss is the close friend and protégé of Hari Seldon, portrayed by Alfred Enoch. There is an immediate attraction between Foss and mathematical prodigy Gaal Dornick when they meet in \"The Emperor\\'s Peace\". During the multi-year journey to Terminus to establish Seldon\\'s repository of human knowledge in \"Preparing to Live\", Dornick and Foss have begun a romantic relationship. Seldon disapproves, as he values science and detachment, and considers emotion and human relationships as distractions. The relationship between Seldon and Foss is also strained, as evidenced by Foss\\'s apparent bitterness about what happened to his real father after he chose to live with Hari, and his alarm when he learns from Dornick that Seldon\\'s computations are not complete. In the middle of her daily swimming ritual, Dornick has a sudden urge to seek out Seldon, and stumbles upon Foss stabbing him to death. Foss ushers her into an escape pod with the murder weapon and jettisons her from the ship. In \"Upon Awakening\", Dornick awakens from cryosleep 34 year later, aboard a automated starship prepared by Foss. He has been executed for Seldon\\'s murder, and she is believed to be an accomplice.\\r\\nA digital, holographic copy of Seldon\\'s consciousness, stored in the knife Foss used to kill him, explains himself to Dornick in \"Mysteries and Martyrs\". Afflicted with a rapidly escalating neurological disorder, he had planned to commit suicide to preserve his followers\\' devotion to his genius, while Dornick helped establish the Foundation on Terminus and Foss was to take the digital Seldon elsewhere. Foss and Dornick\\'s unexpected relationship had jeopardized this plan, so Seldon had convinced Foss to kill him as the only way to guarantee Dornick\\'s future, but in fact to force their separation. Foss had foiled this plan as well by sending Dornick off in the escape pod intended for him. In \"The Missing Piece\", Seldon explains that Foss was supposed to lead a secret, Second Foundation which Seldon created on his home planet, Helicon, and urges Dornick to let the starship take her there but refusing to give details. Done with Seldon\\'s manipulations, Dornick instead takes the escape pod on a journey to Synnax that will last 138 years. Foss and Dornick are revealed to be the biological parents of Salvor Hardin in the 2021 season one finale episode \"The Leap\".\\r\\nFoss is named after, but not based on, Seldon\\'s adoptive son Raych from Asimov\\'s prequel novels Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation.\\r\\n\\r\\nSareth\\r\\nSareth is the newly crowned Queen of Cloud Dominion, portrayed by Ella-Rae Smith in season two. She is described as \"used to being underestimated\", which she uses to her advantage, \"charming her way into the Imperial Palace with biting wit, all while on a secret quest for revenge.\" The reigning Cleon clone, Brother Day, decides to halt the genetic degradation of his bloodline by marrying and fathering an heir with her. Lady Demerzel, an ageless robot and the real power behind the Imperial throne, schemes to be rid of Sareth and retain the Genetic Dynasty of Cleon clones she has administered for centuries. Sareth and Brother Dawn, Day\\'s successor, fall in love and flee Demerzel, with Sareth carrying Dawn\\'s child.\\r\\nThe character Sareth is original to the TV series, and Screen Rant noted that she was added as part of the expansion of Emperor Cleon\\'s role in the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers\\r\\n\\r\\nTellem Bond is the leader of a community of the Mentalics on the planet Ignis, portrayed by  Rachel House in season two. She uses her psychic powers in a destructive and selfish way, inhabiting a succession of young human bodies as a form of immortality while leading a relatively innocuous culture of Metalics seeking sanctuary from persecution elsewhere in the galaxy.\\r\\nRue Corintha is Queen Sareth\\'s politically savvy retainer and advisor, portrayed by Sandra Yi Sencindiver in season two. A former courtesan, Enjoiner Rue shares a past with Brother Dusk, and uses the connection to attempt to weaken his trust in Lady Demerzel, who she has discovered is the last surviving sentient robot. In September 2023, Collider wrote, \"Enjoiner Rue has proven to be the most calculating schemer and manipulator in the Foundation universe so far.\"\\r\\nHugo Crast is a pilot and interplanetary trader from Thespis, portrayed by Daniel MacPherson in seasons one and two. He is Salvor Hardin\\'s loyal friend and lover.

He is sent to Terminus to investigate the loss of contact from the Foundation in the season one episode \"Barbarians at the Gate\". The Aegis is shot down by invading Anacreons in \"Upon Awakening\", and in \"Death and the Maiden\", Dorwin is taken hostage by Phara Keaen, the Grand Huntress of Anacreon, who intends to use him and several Foundation technicians to commandeer a \"lost\" Imperial warship, Invictus. In \"Mysteries and Martyrs\", Keaen uses Dorwin to get through the security protocols of Invictus, and then kills him. His body is discovered over a century later in the season two episode \"In Seldon\\'s Shadow\", alerting the Empire that the Foundation on Terminus has not been destroyed, as they were led to believe.\\r\\nJaegger Fount is a Warden of Terminus and guardian against external threats, portrayed by Holt McCallany in season two. In \"A Glimpse of Darkness\", Hari Seldon\\'s Vault opens, and Fount is incinerated as he approaches it.\\r\\nAbbas and Mari Hardin are members of the Foundation on Terminus and Salvor Hardin\\'s surrogate parents, portrayed by Clarke Peters and Sasha Behar in season one.\\r\\nHalima Ifa is a Zephyr, a senior priestess of the Luminist faith vying to become its next leader, the Proxima, portrayed by T\\'Nia Miller in season one. Joelle Monique of TheWrap praised Miller\\'s \"jaw-dropping performance\".\\r\\nKalle is a mathematician whose work helped Hari Seldon create his Prime Radiant, portrayed by Rowena King in season two. Gaal Dornick uses Kalle\\'s Ninth Proof of Folding to solve the Abraxas Conjecture, which brings Dornick to Seldon\\'s attention.

He does so in \"King and Commoner\", and is transferred into a living body.\\r\\nPhara Keaen is the Grand Huntress of Anacreon, portrayed by Kubbra Sait in season one. She is the top military officer of her planet, and personally leads a raid on Terminus as part of her plan to exact her revenge on the Empire.

In \"Why the Gods Made Wine\", it is revealed via flashback that Yanna had been pregnant with their daughter when she was killed by Dr. Tadj, a university administrator ordered by the Empire to acquire Hari\\'s Prime Radiant. In the novels, Seldon\\'s wife is Dors Venabili, a historian who supports him before and during his development of psychohistory, and is ultimately revealed to be a benevolent robot.\\r\\nShe-Bends-Light is a Spacer on Imperial General Bel Riose\\'s flagship, Shining Destiny, portrayed by Judi Shekoni in season two. In \"A Necessary Death\", trader Hober Mallow approaches the Spacers on Hari Seldon\\'s behalf, but they decline his offer to free them from the Empire\\'s servitude, and turn him over to Riose. In \"Creation Myths\", his capture is revealed to have been a ruse to smuggle a special jump sequence to She-Bends-Light. She uses it to program the fleet\\'s warships to jump into one another, which will inevitably destroy them all and free the remaining Spacers from the Empire.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Manuel Rodulfo Tardo (February 18, 1913 in Pueblo Nuevo, Mantanzas Province, Cuba �  December 22, 1998 in New York City) was a Cuban artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nHe studied at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes \"San Alejandro\", Havana, Cuba, together with Juan Esnard Heydrich y Jos� Francisco Cobos, and at The Sculpture Center, New York City.

He received the UNESCO prize during the 7th Havana Biennial with the artists' collective DUPP (Desde Una Pragmática Pedagógica).\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nYoan Capote lives and works in Havana where he studied arts at the Superior Institute of Art from 1991 to 1995. Even if he first specialized in painting, he finally decided to improve his sculpture skills, considering the latter as a way of developing three-dimensional and multi-sensory possibilities. He is already recognized  in the Cuban art circles - as a promising artist. His work, known to be “solid”, “irreverent”, “provocative”, and “non-conformist” – according to some art critics – deals principally with interactions between individuals and his psychological experiences. Several of his pieces often merges human organs with inanimate objects, rearranges the human body and reinvents the purpose of everyday life objects: the sculpture Nostalgia, which features an ordinary suitcase unzipped to reveal a wall of bricks, can be seen as a metaphor for nomadism and its limits, the wall of bricks standing for our own impediments we all carry with us wherever we go.\\r\\nYoan Capote follows the line of many other internationally known artists, working at the same time with different medias and genres (painting, photography, performance sculptures and installations). One of his works entitled Open Mind 2006 is a labyrinth based on the drawing of the human brain where people can walk. People become metaphors for neurons transmitting information as they walk around the maze. This work inspires reflection on the interrelation among persons, who attempt to coexist with each other.

He came to live in Havana at 7 years old, where he still lives and works today. He is frequently referred to as a \"Naïve\" or \"Outsider\" artist, since he principally works on themes such as childhood and childishness with a visible passion for toys and children’s art.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife and career\\r\\nJEFF’s work has been influenced by his own experience, as he was brought up by his grandparents, and spent his childhood separated from his parents in Oriente Province. When he was 9 years old, his brother found a stick of dynamite and brought it home, JEFF’s curiosity made him lose 3 fingers. From that moment, his work has always aimed at denouncing this world of omnipresent danger. He manipulates the children’s language to create a surprising impression of simplicity. Sailboats made of jagged, rusty metal, or wooden trains transporting severed limbs are some of the toys he created.\\r\\nJEFF began studying art at age 13. When he was age 21, got a grant from the Ludwig Foundation of Cuba (LFC) to produce his Landscape at 21 installations. In 1994, his first solo exhibition at Havana’s Museo Municipal de Alquízar Álvaro Reinoso Valdez with El Rostro Innocente (in English: The Innocent Face) he received his first recognition as a significant artist. El Rostro Innocente installation featured a classroom full of broken chairs in which on the back of each chair was a pair of lead wings and paintings of fetuses with congenital birth defects covered the classroom walls.\\r\\nJEFF was a guest artist of the Havana Biennial from March 27 to April 30, 2009. He created a herd of 12 metal elephants, which he moved from place to place throughout the city during the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards and recognition\\r\\nCollective exhibitions\\r\\nSolo exhibitions\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nCentro de Desarrollo de las Artes Visuales (Cuba) (2005).

Archived from the original on 2011-01-04.', 'Agustín Fernández (16 April 1928  - 2 June 2006) was a Cuban painter, sculptor, and multimedia artist. Although he was born in Cuba, he spent the majority of his career outside of Cuba, and produced art in Havana, Paris, San Juan, and New York.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nAt the age of 11, in 1939, he took his first drawing lessons, soon entering the Jesuit-school Belén de Embarque, where he received painting classes. In 1944 he began studying at the art school La Anexa, and two years later he entered the San Alejandro National Academy of Fine Arts. He also pursued doctoral studies in philosophy and literature at the University of Havana, which he did not complete. After graduating from San Alejandro, he traveled to New York, where he studied with George Grosz and Yasuo Kuniyoshi at the Art Students League.\\r\\nBack in Havana, he exhibited at the Ciudad Cultural Nuestro Tiempo, revealing himself as key emerging artists of the Cuban avant-garde. In 1953, he travels to France and Spain on the British ocean liner \"Queen of the Pacific\". For approximately two years he lives in Spain, attending courses at the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid. In 1953, and until 1955, he was part of the group Los Once. In this first period he exhibited his works in Madrid (Bucholz Gallery, 1953), Washington D.C. (Pan-American Union, 1954), New York (Acquisitions of painting and sculpture, MoMA, 1958), and Caracas (Museum of Fine Arts, 1959). He also participated in the IV and V Biennial of the Museum of Modern Art of Sao Paulo, receiving a mention in 1957.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational career\\r\\nAlthough Fernández began his career in his country, most of his works were made and exhibited abroad. In 1959, with the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, he received a scholarship to study in Paris. Due to political differences, Fernandez decided to go into exile in Paris. There he maintained contact with Simone Collinet - André Breton\\'s first wife, who directed the Fürstenberg Gallery-as well as Roberto Matta, Joan Miró, Max Ernst, Alain Bosquet and Richard Wright. In 1967 he participated in MoMA\\'s retrospective on Latin American art 1931-1966.\\r\\nBy 1969 he moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico, after obtaining a contract with La Casa del Arte gallery. He also exhibited 20 collages on silkscreen at the Colibri Gallery.\\r\\nIn 1972, he moved permanently to New York City. There he became friends with the photographer Robert Mapplethorpe. He exhibited in the following galleries, among others: Anita Shapolsky, Gimpel and Weitzenhoffer Gallery, ACA Gallery, Mitchell Algus and Nina Menocal Gallery, Mexico City. In New York he produced his famous group of paintings: Armors. Agustin Fernandez participated during his career in a variety of art fairs, among them: the May Salon, Paris Internationale, FIAC (Paris), Independent, Frieze (New York) and in Maastricht (Netherlands). In the period 1978-1979 he received a scholarship as a visual artist from the Cintas Foundation. In the 1990s he focused on developing a series of sculptural objects in which he returned to his surrealist essence.\\r\\nIn 1992 Florida International University presented a major retrospective of his work.\\r\\nTwo paintings by Fernández have been featured in cinema: \"Développement d\\'un délire\" appeared in Brian De Palma\\'s film Dressed to Kill (1980), and in The Father of the Bride (2022), starring Cuban American actor Andy Garcia.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate life\\r\\nAgustín Fernández first married María Elena Molinet in 1952. A second marriage followed in 1961 to Lia Epelboim, who had escaped from Romania during the World War II. They had three children: Clodio, Clea and Sebastian. Fernández died on Thursday, June 2, 2006, in New York, at the age of 78, due to complications from pneumonia. Lia had passed away a few weeks earlier. By the time of his death, Fernández had had some thirty solo exhibitions and participated in over one hundred group exhibitions.\\r\\nHe left unpublished memoirs in which he recounts his childhood and youth in Cuba, as well as the influences of masters such as Diego Velázquez in the development of his career as an artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolo exhibitions\\r\\n1951: Agustín Fernández Expone Óleos, Galería Lyceum, Havana, Cuba.\\r\\n1952: Agustín Fernández, Galería Sociedad Nuestro Tiempo, Havana, Cuba.\\r\\n1953: Agustín Fernández, Galería Bucholz, Madrid, Spain, April 24-May 8\\r\\n1954: Agustín Fernández: 15 Paintings, Pan American Union, Washington D.C.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández: Óleos, Gouaches, Galería Lyceum, Havana, Cuba.\\r\\n1955: Agustín Fernández, Duveen Graham Gallery, New York, October 17 November 5\\r\\n1958: Agustín Fernández, Condon Riley Gallery, New York.\\r\\n1959: Agustín Fernández: Pinturas y Dibujos, Museo de Bellas Artes, Caracas, Venezuela.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández: Pinturas y Dibujos, Galería Contemporánea, Caracas, Venezuela.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández: Pinturas y Dibujos, Circulo de Bellas Artes, Maracaibo, Venezuela.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández, Bodley Gallery, New York.\\r\\n1960: Agustín Fernández: Peintures Récentes, Galerie Fürstenberg, Paris.\\r\\n1962: Agustín Fernández, Galleria Del Cavallino, Venice, Italy.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández, Galerie Fürstenberg, Paris.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández, Galleria Del Naviglio Milan, Italy.\\r\\n1964: Agustín Fernández, Galerie Fürstenberg, Paris.\\r\\n1966: Agustín Fernández, Objets-Tableaux, Galerie Jacqueline Ranson, Paris.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández: Objects, Books, Engravings and Collages, Librairie Nicaise, Paris.\\r\\n1968: Agustín Fernández: Pinturas y Dibujos, Galería La Casa del Arte, San Juan, Puerto Rico.\\r\\n1969: Agustín Fernández, Walton Gallery, London.\\r\\n1970: Agustín Fernández: Oleos, Dibujos, Grabados, Galería La Casa del Arte, San Juan, Puerto Rico.\\r\\n1973: Agustín Fernández: Collages, Colibrí Gallery, San Juan, Puerto Rico.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández: Retrospectiva, Museo de la Universidad de Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras.\\r\\n1974: Agustín Fernández: Retrospectiva, at the Galería Las Américas, in San Juan, Puerto Rico\\r\\n1976: Agustín Fernández, Gimpel and Weitzenhoffer Gallery, New York.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández, Gallery 24 Collection, Miami, Florida.\\r\\nAgustín Fernández: Retrospective, Metropolitan Museum and Art Center.\\r\\n1979: Agustín Fernández: Recent Paintings and Drawings, ACA Gallery, New York.\\r\\n1980: Agustín Fernández: Recent Works, Robert Samuel Gallery, New York.\\r\\n1982: Agustín Fernández: Drawings, at the Osuna Gallery, Washington D.C.\\r\\n1989: Agustín Fernández, Galerie Fürstenberg, Paris.\\r\\n1992: Agustín Fernández: A Retrospective, The Art Museum, Florida International University, Miami, Florida.\\r\\n1994: Agustín Fernández: Oleos y Dibujos 1969 1994, Galería Nina Menocal, México D.F.\\r\\n1999: Four Latin American Masters: Agustín Fernández, Perez Celis, Antonio Seguí, Oswaldo Vigas, Anita Shapolsky Gallery, New York.\\r\\n2000: Agustín Fernández: Large Paintings, Signal 66 Gallery, Washington D.C.\\r\\n2001: Agustín Fernández: An Exhibit of Recent Works, Aroca Gallery, Miami, Florida.\\r\\n2005: Agustín Fernández: Paintings, Drawings, Sculpture, Collage: 1960-2005, Mitchell Algus Gallery, New York.\\r\\n2008: Agustín Fernández: Translating Martí, West Dade Regional Library, Miami, Florida.\\r\\n2013: Form’s Transgressions: The Drawings of Agustin Fernandez.

His works are included in many major collections, both private and public, and he has held more than one hundred solo and collective exhibitions worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and education\\r\\nPablo Atchugarry was born in Montevideo, Uruguay on August 23, 1954. His parents, Maria Cristina Bonomi and Pedro Atchugarry Rizzo, were passionate art enthusiasts. Before setting aside his artistic ambitions to support his family, Pedro Atchugarry trained under the great Uruguayan Constructivist Joaquín Torres-García and such experience enabled him to guide his son’s artistic talents and to encourage Pablo to take up painting.\\r\\nAt age eleven, Atchugarry began showing his works and as he progressed through adolescence, he started feeling the need to express himself in various forms and materials, such as cement, iron, and wood. By age eighteen, he had his first personal exhibition of paintings at the Civic Room in Montevideo in 1972 and he had undertaken his first experiment with sculpture – a horse cast in concrete. In the following years as he took up and dropped architectural studies, he found venues in Brazil and Argentina to exhibit his paintings, which featured a mixture of abstraction and Constructivist concepts. However, in 1977, Atchugarry departed South America and traveled to Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer: 1977–1989\\r\\nAtchugarry’s intention in traveling to Europe was to study and perfect his art. As early as 1977, he had his first successful display at an art fair in Copenhagen. During his travels, he visited Spain, France, and Italy, and while visiting Milan he reconnected with a woman he had met in Paris. She brought him to the city of Lecco where he mounted his first solo Italian show in 1978. As a result of the success of the show, his paintings were exhibited in a variety of European cities, including Milan, Copenhagen, Paris, Chur, Bergamo, and Stockholm.\\r\\nAfter experimenting with a range of materials, in 1979, Atchugarry took up carving marble, and he created his first sculpture in Carrara marble entitled La Lumiere. His first monumental sculpture made of Carrara was completed in 1982, and later that year he moved permanently to Lecco. There, he began work on the sculpture, La Pieta, which was carved from a single block of marble weighing twelve tons. In 1987 he held his first solo sculpture exhibition, curated by Raffaele de Grada, in Bramantino’s Crypt in Milan.\\r\\nSince 1989, his poetic sculptural style has caused Atchugarry to express himself through monumental works, which are now situated in various public spaces in Europe and Latin America.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer: 1996 - present\\r\\nIn late 1996, he saw the installation of the sculpture Semilla de la Esperanza (Seed of Hope) in the monumental sculpture park in the grounds of Uruguay’s government building.\\r\\nThe artist founded the Museo Pablo Atchugarry in Lecco, and it was inaugurated on 25 September 1999. This museum houses works spanning Atchugarry’s entire career, as well as bibliographical documentation and an archive. Visitors also have the opportunity to observe him in his workshop, which is located next door to the museum.\\r\\nDuring the spring of 2001, twenty years after his arrival in Italy, the Province of Milan organized a retrospective of Atchugarry’s work entitled “The Infinite Evolutions of Marble” at the Palazzo Isimbardi in Milan. That same year, he sculpted his first monumental work entitled Obelisk of the Third Millennium, a six-meter-high Carrara marble sculpture for the Italian town of Udine.\\r\\nIn early 2002, Atchugarry’s sculpture Ideali in Garfagnana marble was given to the Prince Rainier of Monaco as a tribute to the 50th anniversary of his reign; it is located on the Avenue Princesse Grace of Monte-Carlo. During the spring, his Monument to the Civilisation and Culture of Lecco Labour was inaugurated as the centerpiece of the Caleotto Roundabout in Lecco in May 2002. Made of the Bernini variety of Carrara marble, this work was carved from a 33-ton block and stand 6.10 meters tall. Lastly in July 2002, Atchugarry received the Michelangelo Award in Carrara in recognition of his career as an artist.\\r\\nHis sculpture entitled Sensation of the Infinite was added to the collection of the Lercaro Museum in Bologna in 2003. That same year, Atchugarry represented Uruguay in the 50th International Exhibition of the Visual Arts at the Venice Biennale of 2003 with an installation of eight sculptures in Carrara marble and Grey Bardiglio marble entitled Dreaming of Peace.\\r\\nIn 2005 the Berardo Collection in Lisbon, Portugal added to its patrimony Camino Vital, 1999, standing nearly 5 meters tall in Carrara marble. Another important project undertaken by Atchugarry during 2005 was the opening of a new atelier at Punta del Este, Uruguay, where he works during the European winter.\\r\\nAtchugarry opened the Fundación Pablo Atchugarry in Manatiales, Uruguay in January 2007. This institution aims to provide a stimulus for the arts and create a place for artists of all disciplines to meet in an ideal location that combines nature and art.\\r\\nAfter seven years of work, the artist completed the monumental sculpture Cosmic Embrace (2005-2011) in 2011. That same year, Hollis Taggart Galleries in New York City organized a solo show “Pablo Atchugarry: Heroic Activities” that featured an essay by the notable art critic, Jonathan Goodman.  Expanding his presence in New York, the Time Square Alliance association selected Atchugarry’s sculpture Dreaming New York to be exhibited in Times Square during The Armory Show Art Fair in New York City during March 2012.\\r\\nIn late 2013, Mondadori Electa published the Catalogo Generale delle scultura, two volumes edited by Professor Carlo Pirovano cataloging every sculpture produced by the artist between 1971 and 2013.\\r\\nIn 2014, a work apparently by Atchugarry named The Don was described by a public art coordinator in a report to Cambridge City Council, England, as \"possibly the poorest quality work that has ever been submitted to the council\", which refused planning permission for the sculpture. In 2024, the council ordered its removal after it appeared in another location without permission. \\r\\nAtchugarry currently lives and works between Lecco and Manantiales where he oversees the development of the Fundación Pablo Atchugarry and the international monumental sculpture park, as well as teaching and promoting art.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaterials and style\\r\\nFor each sculpture, Atchugarry personally selects an appropriate block and is actively involved in carving it, with minimal help from assistants. He works with white Carrara marble from Tuscany, gray stone from Bardiglio, black from Belgium, and pink from Portugal. Aside from working with stone, he utilizes bronze finished in various patinas, ceramic, and, more rarely, various types of wood.\\r\\nThere is no ideal view from which to examine one of Atchugarry’s sculptures. The viewer is supposed to observe each work as a whole, and contemplate how all of the sculpture’s parts work together. Though composed in different materials, his works are united by a tightly defined set of forms that he consistently recombines. Manipulating sinuous curves, accordion folds, ovoid apertures, and a typically vertical alignment, Atchugarry creates forms that are highly evocative of plants and trees, breaking waves, still lifes, and the human figure. Thus, his sculptures are both figural and abstract.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\nIn 1972, Atchugarry had his first personal exhibition of paintings at the Civic Room in Montevideo, Uruguay.\\r\\nIn 1987, the artist held his first solo sculpture exhibition in Bramantino’s Crypt in Milan.\\r\\nDuring the spring of 2001, the Province of Milan organized a retrospective of Atchugarry’s work entitled “The Infinite Evolutions of Marble” at the Palazzo Isimbardi in Milan.\\r\\nIn 2003, Atchugarry represented Uruguay in the 50th International Exhibition of the Visual Arts at the Venice Biennale of 2003 with an installation of eight sculptures in Garrara marble and Grey Bardiglio marble entitled Dreaming of Peace.\\r\\nFrom 2007 to 2008, a retrospective exhibition dedicated to his work entitled “The Plastic Space of Light” was held in Brazil, accompanied by a critical text written by Luca Massimo Barbero. Province of Milan Initially staged at the Banco do Brasil Cultural Centre in Brasilia, the exhibition travelled to the MuBe (Museu Brasileiro da Escultura) in São Paulo and the Museu Oscar Niemeyer in Curitiba.\\r\\nDuring the winter of 2011, Hollis Taggart Galleries in New York mountedthe solo show “Pablo Atchugarry: Heroic Activities.” Hollis Taggart Galleries held another show of the artist’s work titled “Pablo Atchugarry: Lives in Stone” from 7 November 2013 to 4 January 2014.\\r\\nFrom 22 May 2015 to 7 February 2016, forty sculptures by Atchugarry were exhibited at the Museum dei Fori Imperiali – Mercati di Traino in Rome as part of the exhibition “Eternal City, eternal marbles.”\\r\\nDuring spring 2016, Hollis Taggart exhibited “Pablo Atchugarry: Invocations of the Soul” from 5 May to 11 June 2016. The catalog for this show contains original texts by Luciano Caprile, Jonathan Goodman, Fundación Pablo Atchugarry and Pietro Dormia as well as press releases and photographs from other major exhibitions of Atchugarry’s work.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nAtchugarry, Pablo.

Eric Gill produced several works for the hotel.\\r\\nThese were two seahorses, modelled as Morecambe shrimps, for the outside entrance, a round plaster relief on the ceiling of the circular staircase inside the hotel, a decorative wall map of the north west of England, and a large stone relief of Odysseus being welcomed from the sea by Nausicaa.\\r\\nThe hotel had gradually become run down and neglected and eventually closed its doors to the public in 1993, but early in 2003 it was purchased by Urban Splash, a Manchester-based property company. Rebuilding work began in June 2005 and was completed three years later.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two seahorses\\r\\nThe seahorses were carved in situ from Portland stone by Gill and his assistant, Donald Potter. When the hotel was renovated, it was found that the seahorses had been painted red and that they were much affected from exposure to the salty air. They were cleaned and repaired by craftsmen from Burnaby Stone Care Ltd.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Neptune and Triton medallion\\r\\nDesigned and carved by Eric Gill and painted by Denis Tegetmeier (Gill’s son-in-law, who was a book illustrator). The medallion is on the ceiling at the top of the circular staircase in the hotel’s central tower. It is coloured in blue, blue green, yellow, and shades of red brown, and has the inscription \"and hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn,\" words from a sonnet by William Wordsworth. The medallion is 10 feet (3.05 m) in diameter. Neptune sits wearing a crown and Triton emerges from the sea, clasping his golden horn in his hands. Two mermaids complete the ensemble. During the hotel’s renovation, the medallion was repaired and the colours restored by Brian Cardy of Urban Splash. Gill had added the marks of stigmata on Neptune. This is thought to have come about due to the death of his father, whom he also tried to depict in the face of Triton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Odysseus welcomed from the sea by Nausicaa\"\\r\\nPositioned in the entrance lounge, and behind the reception desk, this 10 ft 5 in (3.175 m) × 16 ft (4.877 m) bas-relief was carved in situ from Portland stone by Eric Gill with Laurie Cribb carrying out the lettering.\\r\\nThe bas-relief has the inscription \"There is good hope that thou mayest see thy friends\", and \"Homer/Ody\" in smaller capitals.  This is repeated in Greek with \"Eric G\" added.  Odysseus is shown being welcomed from the sea by Nausicaa, who is attended by three female servants. One carries a bowl of fruit, the second a jug and goblet and the third a garment. The panel is based on three episodes of a story in Homer’s Odyssey.\\r\\n\\r\\nMap of North West England\\r\\nAgain carved and designed by Eric Gill and painted by Denis Tegetmeier in oil paint on a polished, natural ivory coloured \"Marplax\" surface on a plaster ground and measuring 8 ft 6 in (2.59 m) x 17 ft 2 in (5.23 m). Completed in 1933, the map shows the northwest coastline from Whitehaven in the north to Birkenhead in the south, with many places being indicated by a feature associated with them. The London Midland & Scottish connection sees mention of the Midland Hotel itself, the Adelphi Hotel in Liverpool and the Royal Scot train. Among other features represented are Blackpool Tower, Furness Abbey, Lancaster Castle, the factory chimneys of Liverpool and Preston,  Liverpool\\'s two cathedrals, and the shipyard cranes of Barrow-in-Furness, as well as the coal mines of Whitehaven. The Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral depicted was based on Edwin Lutyens\\' proposed building which was never finished: the present Roman Catholic cathedral stands where Lutyens\\' building would have stood. The Lake District is shown for the most part as an idyllic part of the region with, for example, hounds chasing a fox near Haweswater and leafy trees, blue lakes and rounded fells.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nArticle on Eric Gill on The National Archives website', 'Julio Uruguay Alpuy (January 27, 1919 – April 5, 2009) was an Uruguayan painter, sculptor, and muralist. During his early career, Alpuy was a part of the Taller Torres-García (School of the South) and the constructive art movement. While his early works were greatly influenced by Torres-García\\'s theories about what he called Constructive Universalism, Alpuy drew from a wide variety of cultures and myths to create works that broke the boundaries of the constructive grid. Additionally, his studies in Europe and Latin America helped develop an interest in Cubism and myths that influenced later works. Alpuy had a prolific career and his works are exhibited throughout the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nAlpuy was born in Tacuarembó, Uruguay, the capital of the Tacuarembó department in northern Uruguay, on January 27, 1919, to Sixto Alpuy and Virginia Bevans. When Alpuy was 18 months old his mother died, so he was raised by his paternal grandmother and aunts. Alpuy\\'s childhood was spent in the countryside, where he learned various farming skills, but he also attended school. At the age of sixteen, Alpuy was sent to Montevideo to continue his education. However, to pay for school he worked during the day and went to night classes. While in Montevideo, Alpuy became friends with members the Libertarian Youth (Juventudes Libertarias). Alpuy attributes these years in association with the Juventudes Libertarias to have helped further his understandings of freedom, justice, and respect. During these early years, Alpuy had little to no interaction with art.\\r\\nIn 1939, Alpuy walked into an exhibition of José Cúneo\\'s watercolors. Alpuy was amazed at the watercolors, so he bought various supplies and began drawing. Shortly after, Víctor Bachetta, a member of the Association of Constructive Art, connected Alpuy with Joaquín Torres-Garcia. Alpuy then joined the Taller Torres-García (TTG) in 1940. Alpuy\\'s years at the TTG changed the trajectory of his life. He found a community that taught him how to create, but also challenged him intellectually.\\r\\nAfter several years studying under Torres-Garcia, Alpuy began traveling around Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East. These travels provide new materials and ideas for Alpuy, as well as induced him to many new artist and thinkers. In between his travels abroad, Alpuy taught drawing at the TTG until 1955. His students include José Collell, Walter Deliotti, and Mario Lorieto.\\r\\nBy 1961, with over twenty years of experience he moved to New York City, NY and in 1965 married Joana Simoes. Over the next forty-plus years, Alpuy lived and worked in New York. This remained his permanent residence until his death on April 5, 2009, at the age of 90.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nThe Taller Torres-García (TTG)\\r\\nAlpuy\\'s time at the TTG with Torres-Garcia and the other artists was invaluable. Torres-Garcia led a school where developing an ethical approach to artmaking was as important as the work itself. He taught his students how to create with various mediums including stone, wood, and clay, as well as the theory of Constructive Universalism. Torres-García hoped to construct a universally understandable form of art that transcended the bounds of time and culture. He composed his works through the use of a grid or as he called it \"structure\" whose proportions were set with the geometry of the Golden Mean, a recurrent number in the history of art that also appears in natural forms. He then chose archetypal symbols which he believed communicated universal messages and situated them inside the structure that organized the composition. The theory of Constructive Universalism began to shape Alpuy\\'s work, and by the mid-forties he was painting in a style similar to the artists at the Taller.\\r\\nWhile Alpuy and the other artists at the TTG focused on creating a form of art linked to the more general tradition of abstraction, they were also interested in the art of ancient cultures, especially those of South America. In December 1945, Torres-García encouraged Alpuy, and several others at the Taller, to travel in Latin America and study pre-Columbian art. Alpuy traveled primarily in Bolivia and Peru, and visited the \"Gate of the Sun\" in Tiwanaku. He additionally visited \"Island of the Sun\" and \"Island of the Moon\" at Lake Titicaca and Machu Picchu. Alpuy credits this experience in helping him understand Torres-García\\'s ideas.\\r\\nAfter Torres-García\\'s death, in August 1949, Alpuy began teaching drawing at the Taller. He remained there until 1955. During these years Alpuy continued to develop his understanding of Constructive Universalism, but he began to divert from Torres-García\\'s constructive style. Instead, Alpuy began delving into new mediums and ideas, and eventually left the school in 1956 to seek his own path.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational travels\\r\\nWhile Alpuy\\'s time at the TTG was transformational, his international travels further developed his own artistic identity. Even though Alpuy traveled abroad before his Bolivia and Peru trip of 1945, that journey began Alpuy\\'s extensive traveling.\\r\\nIn December 1951, Alpuy left South America for Europe. He spent time in Greece where he studied classical and Byzantine architecture, sculpture, and mosaic. In the following January, Alpuy connected with Gonzalo Fonseca, a TTG artist, in Beirut, Lebanon. From Beirut, Alpuy and Fonseca toured Syria and Egypt, and paid special attention to Karnak while in Egypt. The Egyptian murals and hieroglyphs were very important for Alpuy because much of his interest in Constructive Universalism was focused on employing symbols and archetypes to project a message. The murals in Egypt encapsulated this for many TTG artists. After the Middle East, Alpuy returned to Europe and spent the majority of his time in Venice and Paris. While in Paris, Alpuy further studied Egyptian mythology. His notes highlight his interest in the Book of the Dead, which influenced some of Alpuy\\'s later works. In 1953, Alpuy ended his European tour in Madrid, and then returned to Montevideo.\\r\\nThis period of travel provided new sources of inspiration for Alpuy. It helped him develop further interest in ancient cultures and the imagery these cultures used. Alpuy was not merely fascinated by images that were constructed, but how nature was the life-giving source to all. He became interested in the \"magic\" or myths found in many cultures. These new ideas, along with an evolving style caused him to break away from the TTG\\'s teachings, and create his own style of art using the framework in which he had been trained.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York\\r\\nAfter Alpuy left the TTG, he received a grant from the New School for Social Research in New York City. Encouraged by the grant and the presence of Augusto Torres and Gonzalo Fonseca, fellow TTG artists, in New York, Alpuy decided to move permanently to the city. This new environment offered Alpuy a canvas for creating, and he took full advantage of it. In the winter of 1962, Alpuy began to experiment in forming wood plates. This medium enabled Alpuy to express his thoughts on myth, nature, and human consciousness in a new way. These plates received mixed reviews, and some critics mentioned the influences of Torres-Garcia in the work, while others noted Alpuy\\'s distancing from his previous work at the TTG. By the late 1960s, Alpuy evolved his new wooden works to included statuary and wood panels.\\r\\nEven though Alpuy occasionally traveled to Montevideo and other Latin American countries for exhibitions and commissions, Alpuy resided primarily in New York. In 1975, Alpuy began to teach drawing and painting classes in his studio. This interaction with the canvas reconnected him to his roots in painting, and he began to paint more often, primarily focusing on the individual in primeval landscapes and nature itself.\\r\\nAlpuy continued to make and exhibit his art into his eighties. However, during his years in New York City he adamantly argued that he was not influenced by his environment. He states that he was a fully developed artist by the time he moved to New York. Additionally, Alpuy occasionally worked as a carpenter, so that the integrity of his work would not be influenced by money. Alpuy\\'s works are still exhibited today, and he has gained recognition as one of the great Uruguayan artists.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\nOne-man shows\\r\\n1948 - Vian Gallery, Buenos Aires, Argentina\\r\\n1956 - Sociedad Amigos del Arte, Montevideo Uruguay\\r\\n1958 - Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango, Bogota, Colombia\\r\\n1959 - Fundaciones Mendoza, Caracas, Venezuela\\r\\n1959 - Universidad de Carabobo, Valencia, Venezuela\\r\\n1960 - Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango, Bogota, Colombia\\r\\n1964 - J.

The book was tapped out on a mobile phone in a series of single messages over time and translated from Persian into English by Omid Tofighian.\\r\\nAfter the November 2022 publication of his second collection of writings, Freedom, Only Freedom : The Prison Writings of Behrouz Boochani, Boochani visited Australia for the first time to promote the book in December 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife\\r\\nIn Iran\\r\\nBoochani was born in Ilam, Iran in 1983. He has described himself as \"a child of war\", referring to the 1980s war between the Iraqi Ba\\'athists and \"Iranian zealots\" fought largely in his Kurdish homeland in western Iran. He graduated from Tarbiat Modares University and the Tarbiat Moallem University (now named Kharazmi University), both in Tehran, with a master\\'s degree in political science, political geography and geopolitics.\\r\\nHe began his journalistic career writing for the student newspaper at Tarbiat Modares University, before working as a freelance journalist for several Iranian newspapers such as Kasbokar Weekly, Qanoon, and Tehran\\r\\n-based Etemaad as well as the Iranian Sports Agency. He wrote articles on Middle East politics, minority rights and the survival of Kurdish culture. In secret, he taught children and adults a particular Kurdish dialect from the region of Ilam, regarded as their mother tongue. He co-founded and produced the Kurdish magazine Werya (also spelt Varia), which he regarded as his most important work, and which attracted the attention of the Iranian authorities because of its political and social content.  The magazine promoted Kurdish culture and politics; Boochani felt it very important for the Kurdish city of Ilam to retain its Kurdish identity, language and culture. As a member of the Kurdish Democratic party, outlawed in Iran, and the National Union of Kurdish Students, he was watched closely.\\r\\nIn February 2013, the offices of Werya were raided by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was founded after the 1979 revolution to protect the country\\'s Islamic Republic system and to quell uprisings of \"deviant movements\", and had previously threatened Boochani with detention. Boochani was not in the office that day, but 11 of Boochani\\'s colleagues were arrested, several of whom were subsequently imprisoned. After publishing news of the arrests online and the news spreading globally, Boochani went into hiding for three months and on 23 May 2013, fled Iran and made his way to Indonesia via Southeast Asia.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn detention\\r\\nIn July 2013, on his second attempt to make a crossing from Indonesia to Australia in a boat carrying 60 asylum seekers, the boat was intercepted by the Royal Australian Navy. Boochani and his fellow asylum seekers were detained first on Christmas Island and after one month transferred to the Manus Island detention centre in August 2013, as part of Australia\\'s Pacific Solution II. Manus is where the Australian government detains single male refugees, whose maritime arrivals are six times more numerous than that of women.\\r\\nBoochani started making contact with journalists and human rights defenders outside the camp. He gathered information about human rights abuses within the camp and sent them via a secret mobile phone to news organisations and advocacy groups such as The Guardian, The Sydney Morning Herald, the Refugee Action Collective, and the United Nations. In September 2015, PEN International (the Melbourne and Norwegian branches of which Boochani is now an honorary member) and a coalition of human rights groups launched an international campaign on Boochani\\'s behalf, urging the Australian government to abide by its obligations to the principle of non-refoulement, as defined by Article 33 of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Several campaigns have urged individuals to write to Peter Dutton, Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, the Australian Prime Minister and high commissioners. Reporters without Borders warned that dissent was not tolerated by Iran\\'s theocratic regime, and that Boochani\\'s \"freedom would be in great danger if he were forced to return to Iran\". Boochani has asked repeatedly to be handed to the UN.\\r\\nHe also became a spokesperson for the men in his compound, Foxtrot, meeting with PNG immigration and other officials as well as Amnesty International and the UNHCR representatives. He was moved to Chauka, the solitary confinement block constructed of shipping containers, for three days. He was also jailed during the 2015 hunger strike that was put down by force; he spent eight days inside Lorengau prison and was then released without charge after being asked to stop reporting.\\r\\nHe said in a radio interview on Autonomous Action Radio ahead of the release of his film Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time in 2016 that it was his intention to show the Australian public what the government was doing to detainees on the island, and spoke of the mental torture caused by being deprived of hope.\\r\\nIn March 2017, Boochani\\'s plight was raised in the Australian House of Representatives by Australian parliamentarian Adam Bandt.\\r\\nAlthough forcibly moved to accommodation outside the detention centre some weeks after it was officially closed on 31 October 2017, Boochani could not leave the island without travel documents. The only way to reach the nearby town of Lorengau is on an official bus, and the refugees are routinely body-searched when they leave and return. He wrote of what was happening and of his fear during the siege that followed the closure, as well as the articles he wrote for The Guardian at the time, among other things, in WhatsApp messages to translator and friend Omid Tofighian, later published in full.\\r\\nOn 28 November 2017, Boochani sent a message to the Australian public via the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre (ASRC) which was published on their website, thanking them for their humanity, and describing the recent peaceful protest by refugees on the island after the closure of the detention centre, which was met with force. He said that Peter Dutton was not correct in saying that their only desire was to come to Australia; they only want freedom and safety in any safe country, and they were not free nor safe on Manus.\\r\\nIn a speech delivered to guests at a Human Rights Law Centre dinner in 2018, he expressed the view that the Australian Government was manipulating its people, using propaganda that centres on national security. In a radio interview with SBS Radio, he thanked the \"many brave people in Australia who have been fighting against this system\", saying that Australian people are not cruel and were they fully aware of what is exactly happening, they would not have let their government do this.\\r\\nBoochani was featured as the subject of ABC TV\\'s Australian Story. He said that he would not be following through with resettlement in Papua New Guinea, and now regrets his decision to aim for Australia.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom\\r\\nOn 14 November 2019, Boochani left Manus and travelled to New Zealand on a one-month visa to speak at the WORD Christchurch festival in Christchurch. Boochani said upon arrival that he was savouring life as a \"free man\". The US has technically accepted him as part of the “refugee swap” deal, but now that he has left PNG, he fears that his status is uncertain. If the US offer is revoked, he will look at the possibilities of applying to another country.\\r\\nBoochani feels a sense of duty towards the men he was forced to leave behind on PNG. Apart from those who have died, he said that about three-quarters of the refugees and asylum seekers sent to the Manus camp since 2012 have left,  to Australia, the US or other countries. However he is deeply concerned that some remain trapped there, especially the 46 who are being held in Bomana prison in Port Moresby.\\r\\nStill in New Zealand in late February 2020, Boochani, responding to Peter Dutton\\'s comment that he would never be allowed into Australia, said that he has never said that he wanted to go to Australia. It was not yet known whether he had applied for asylum in New Zealand.\\r\\nOn 24 July 2020, the New Zealand Government granted refugee status to Boochani, allowing him to stay in New Zealand indefinitely and to apply for a residency visa. On that day it was also announced that Boochani had been appointed a Senior Adjunct Research Fellow of the University of Canterbury, based at Kā Waimaero, the Ngāi Tahu Research Centre.\\r\\nOn 6 December 2022 Boochani started a tour of Australia, with several speaking engagements in Sydney and elsewhere. It is a work trip to promote his new book, Freedom, Only Freedom. He has also given radio interviews.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks from Manus Island\\r\\nWhile living in the Manus Island detention centre Boochani has had many of his articles published by online news and other media, such as \"The day my friend Hamid Kehazaei died\" in The Guardian and  \"Life on Manus: Island of the Damned\" in The Saturday Paper, and others by HuffPost, Financial Times, and the New Matilda. Guardian journalist Ben Doherty, upon accepting the Amnesty International Australia award on Behrouz\\'s behalf in 2017, said that Boochani \"...rightly, sees himself as a working journalist on Manus Island, whose job it is to be bear witness to the injustices and the violence and the privation of offshore detention\". Some of his articles have been published on Kurdish websites in Iran.\\r\\nHe has also published poems online and narrates his story in the award-winning animated short documentary film Nowhere Lines: Voices of Manus Island, made by UK film-maker Lucas Schrank in 2015). In 2017 he was the subject and co-producer of the award-winning Until We Are All Free, a graphic narrative in collaboration with Positive/Negatives and illustrator, Alex Mankiewicz.\\r\\nThe film Chauka, Please Tell Us the Time was shot inside the Manus Island detention centre by Boochani, entirely on a mobile phone, and released on 11 June 2017 at the Sydney Film Festival. A review of the film was written by the award winning writer Arnold Zable.\\r\\nIn February 2018, he wrote an article about the murder of his friend Reza Barati during riots at the camp in 2014 and the injustice of the events that followed. Included is a poem about his \"gentle giant and best friend\", called Our Mothers, a poem for Reza. In March 2018 the full-length documentary film, Stop the Boats! (the title reflecting a government slogan), directed by Simon V. Kurian, was released, featuring Boochani and others.\\r\\nAt the end of the 2019 short documentary film Manus, made by Angus McDonald, Boochani narrates his poem called \"Manus Poem\" in Persian.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo Friend But the Mountains\\r\\nIn July 2018, his memoir No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison was published by Picador. Written in prose and poetry, it chronicles his boat journey from Indonesia, his detainment on Manus Island and the lives (and deaths) of other prisoners, as well as observations on the Australian guards and the local Papuan people. The book was laboriously tapped out on a mobile phone in Persian in fragments via WhatsApp and translated from the Persian to English by his friend Omid Tofighian. He posits that the prison is a Kyriarchal system (a term borrowed from feminist theory), one where different forms of oppression intersect; oppression is not random but purposeful, designed to isolate and create friction amongst prisoners, leading to despair and broken spirits. \\r\\nIn his foreword to the work, Australian writer Richard Flanagan refers to Boochani as \"a great Australian writer\". Louis Klee wrote in the Times Literary Supplement, \"In a decade of Australian politics defined by the leadership spill—a spilt decade, in which any meaningful progress on the issues that define Australia, be it Indigenous affairs, refugee politics, or climate change, effectively stalled—Boochani\\'s witnessing has elevated him to a paradoxical position. Today he may well be the most significant political voice in a country he has never visited\". \\r\\nNo Friend But the Mountains won the Victorian Prize for Literature and the Victorian Premier\\'s Prize for Nonfiction on 31 January 2019. There were questions about Boochani\\'s eligibility for both prizes because entrants had been previously limited to Australian citizens or permanent residents, but he was given an exemption by prize administrators and the judges were unanimous in recognising its literary excellence. Wheeler Centre director Michael Williams said that the judges thought that the story of what\\'s happening on Manus Island essentially is an Australian story, and that \"made it completely consistent with the intention of the awards\". In an interview with the writer Arnold Zable following the award, Boochani said that he has many conflicting thoughts on it, but he sees it as a \"political statement from the literary and creative arts community in Australia, and all those who do not agree with the government\\'s thinking\".\\r\\nIn April 2019 the book was given a Special Award in the New South Wales Premier\\'s Literary Awards, whose judges called it \"an outstanding work of literature in its own right\", apart from being \"...remarkable for the circumstances of its production...[and]...compelling and shocking content\".\\r\\nOn 2 May, it was announced that the work had won the Australian Book Industry Award (ABIA) for General non-fiction book of the year.\\r\\nA film of the book is due to be made in 2021, shot mainly in Australia. Boochani said the new film should incorporate some of his previous work, and that of his fellow asylum seekers, as a record of part of Australian history.\\r\\nThe film is to be directed by Rodd Rathjen and has been announced as one of the projects selected for the virtual 15th Ontario Creates International Financing Forum in association with Toronto International Film Festival. Rathjen will work in close collaboration with Boochani (who takes on the roles of story consultant and associate producer) and writer and producer Ákos Armont.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemain (video installation)\\r\\nBoochani collaborated with Iranian-born Melbourne photographer Hoda Afshar on a two-channel video work, Remain, which includes spoken poetry by him and Iranian poet Bijan Elahi. Afshar describes her method as \"staged documentary\", in which the men on the island are able to \"re-enact their narratives with their own bodies and [gives] them autonomy to narrate their own stories.\" The video was shown as part of the Primavera 2018 exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia in Sydney, from 9 November 2018 to 3 February 2019. Both Afshar and Boochani believe that art can hit home in a more powerful way, after the public has become immune to images of and journalism about suffering. Writing about an award-winning portrait of himself by Afshar taken as part of the Remain project, Boochani says that the project would be part of the creation of a \"new artistic language that is not beholden to the framework of colonialism\", and in accordance with the \"Manus Prison Theory\".\\r\\n\\r\\nManus (play)\\r\\nBoochani is one of the subjects of, as well as chief collaborator on, the play Manus written by Leila Hekmatnia and Keyvan Sarreshteh, Directed by Nazanin Sahamizadeh in 2017, which tells the story of eight Iranians who fled Iran for Australia. It relates the stories of their lives in Iran and their experiences in detention on Manus, including details of the riot in February 2014, which led to the murder of one of them, Reza Barati, by locals.  It was performed in Tehran in February–March 2017, running for a month in the Qashqai Hall of the City Theatre Complex and attended by nearly 3000 people, including Abbas Araghchi, Iran\\'s deputy foreign minister, and Australian diplomats. It was also performed in two cities in Bangladesh in October 2017, at the Chittagong Shilpakala Academy in Chittagong and in Dhaka. The director Sahamizadeh said it was performed there as a part of its international tour to express compassion and solidarity with Rohingya refugees from Myanmar who had sought protection in Bangladesh recently. It will be directed by the author and produced by the Verbatim Theatre Group at the Adelaide Festival in March 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater works\\r\\nIn March 2023 a production of Euripides\\' play Women of Troy, directed by Ben Winspear and starring his wife actor-producer Marta Dusseldorp was staged at the 10 Days on the Island festival in Tasmania. Poetry Boochani was set to music composed by Katie Noonan and performed by a chorus of Tasmanian women and girls, interspersed with the text of the play.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards and recognition\\r\\nDiaspora Symposium Social Justice Award in October 2016.\\r\\nOn the shortlist of four for the Index on Censorship\\'s Freedom of Expression Award in the category of Journalism in 2017.\\r\\nTampa Award, April 2018, presented by Rural Australians for Refugees, for \"selfless and substantial contribution to the welfare of refugees\".\\r\\nAmnesty International Australia 2017 Media Award, for his work on The Guardian and The Saturday Paper.\\r\\nSTARTTS Humanitarian Award (Media), for \"Media outlets, journalists or media officers supporting, prioritising and/or raising awareness of refugee issues\".\\r\\nVoltaire Award, Empty Chair Award, awarded July 2018 by Liberty Australia.\\r\\nAnna Politkovskaya Award for Journalism, October 2018.\\r\\nSir Ronald Wilson Human Rights Award, October 2018.\\r\\nVictorian Prize for Literature and the Victorian Premier\\'s Prize for Nonfiction, January 2019, for No Friend But the Mountains: Writing from Manus Prison..\\r\\nSpecial Award, New South Wales Premier\\'s Literary Awards, April 2019, for No Friend But the Mountains.\\r\\nGeneral Non-Fiction Book of the Year, Australian Book Industry Awards, April 2019, for No Friend But the Mountains.\\r\\nNational Biography Award, August 2019, for No Friend But the Mountains.\\r\\nAudiobook of the year, Australian Book Industry Awards, 2020 for No Friend But the Mountains.\\r\\nA portrait of Boochani by artist Angus McDonald won the People\\'s Choice Award in the Archibald Prize, a prestigious Australian portraiture art award, in 2020.\\r\\n\\r\\nList of works\\r\\nFilm and video\\r\\nChauka, Please Tell Us the Time. 2016 (Documentary film)\\r\\nRemain. 2018.

Una donna, lit.\\u2009\\'Oriana: A Woman\\') is a biography of the Italian journalist and writer Oriana Fallaci. It was written by Cristina De Stefano and published by Rizzoli in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary\\r\\nThe book covers Oriana Fallaci\\'s life, beginning with her teenage years and partisan activities during World War II. The height of her career as a journalist was in the 1960s and 1970s, when she became known and influential for using a distinctive reportorial voice and interviewing major figures of international politics. The book goes into Fallaci\\'s love life and her tendency for overstatements. The book tells about Fallaci\\'s life based on archival material, unpublished personal testimonies and interviews with her friends and colleagues, who often gave contradictory accounts.\\r\\n\\r\\nReception\\r\\nJohn Domini of The Washington Post said the book \"rises to the challenges\" of covering Fallaci\\'s dramatic life and that the English translation by Marina Harss, published by Other Press in 2017, \"never lacks for clarity\". Publishers Weekly called it \"an intimate investigation into a larger-than-life personality who, in the end, was just another lonely soul\". Dwight Garner of The New York Times wrote that the book \"is not particularly well-written or thoughtful but it gets [Fallaci\\'s] story onto the page and, thanks to its subject, is never dull\".\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nOther Press', 'Providence is a twelve-issue comic book limited series written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Jacen Burrows, published by American company Avatar Press from 2015 to 2017. The story is both a prequel and sequel to Moore\\'s previous stories Neonomicon and The Courtyard, and continues exploring H. P. Lovecraft\\'s Cthulhu Mythos.\\r\\n\\r\\nSynopsis\\r\\nThe series is set in 1919 and centres on Robert Black, a homosexual Jewish writer,  initially working in New York as a reporter for the New York Herald. Black takes a leave of absence from his journalism career, with the intention of writing a Great American Novel using \"the “Outsiders”, perhaps “occult Outsiders”—whom he is on the trail of across New England—as a metaphor for social outsiders\".\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot\\r\\nI: The Yellow Sign\\r\\nRobert Black, a reporter for the New York Herald and aspiring novelist, is sent by his editor, Mr. Posey, to \"scare up\" a story about an infamous book called Sous Le Monde, which is rumoured to drive its readers insane. Robert visits one Doctor Alvarez, who once wrote an essay on the subject. Arriving at Alvarez\\'s tenement, the door is answered by his landlady and lover, Mrs. Ortega, who shows him upstairs. In Alvarez\\'s heavily air-conditioned apartment, Robert learns that the book mentions \"an early Arab alchemical text\" known as Kitab Al-Hikmah Al-Najmiyya (\"The Book of Starry Wisdom\"), which describes methods of prolonging life. He also learns that Alvarez was provided with a transcript by a man called Suydam. Feeling inspired and intrigued by this story, Robert returns to his office, where he learns that his jilted gay lover, Jonathan, has committed suicide in one of New York\\'s Lethal Chambers.\\r\\n\\r\\nII: The Hook\\r\\nInspired to write his novel, Robert goes on sabbatical from the Herald and heads to Flatbush in search of Suydam. Mr. Posey puts him in touch with Detective Tom Malone, who shows him the church where Suydam lectures on occult philosophy. As they stake out the churchyard where Suydam often walks, Malone makes it clear that he\\'s attracted to Robert. Suydam appears, cutting their conversation short, and Robert introduces himself as an occult scholar. Suydam invites Robert to his home to sell him some of his pamphlets and tells him more about the Kitab, a copy of which is held by his suppliers in Salem, Massachusetts. When Suydam is called away, Robert sneaks into his basement and finds a vast sea cave containing a golden totem and human remains. He is attacked by a glowing female monster and flees, only to lose consciousness. Robert wakes up to find Suydam standing over him. He goes on his way, determined to investigate further.\\r\\n\\r\\nIII: A Lurking Fear\\r\\nUpon arriving in Salem, Robert checks in at the Hillman Hotel to locate Tobit Boggs, the man mentioned by Suydam. He walks to the Boggs Refinery and meets Boggs, who tells him about the occult group Stella Sapiente and that he obtained his transcript of the Kitab from one Garland Wheatley. He shows him a \"rum run\" tunnel leading to a chamber connected to the sea where Boggs\\' grandfather brought in fish people to Salem. That night at his hotel, Robert has a terrible nightmare involving his dead lover Jonathan, Tom Malone, swastikas, gas chambers and fish people. He checks out the next day and leaves town by bus, noting that the other passengers all look like fish-human hybrids.\\r\\n\\r\\nIV: White Apes\\r\\nRobert gets his hair cut in Athol, and learns from his barber about Garland Wheatley, a local \"medicine man\". He walks to the Wheatleys\\' farm and meets Wheatley himself, who informs him that he parted ways with the Stella Sapiente sect, but that there is a copy of the Kitab in the library at Saint Anselm College. He introduces Robert to his albino daughter, Leticia, and semi-human grandson, Willard. Willard takes an instant dislike to Robert, having perceived that Robert is \"aht uv a diff\\'run\\' story awlduhgethuh\". He leaves Robert in his shed and, unbeknownst to Robert, intends to feed him to his invisible monster brother. Aware of Robert\\'s danger, Wheatley sees him off the property and warns him not to cut across the fields on his way back to town.\\r\\n\\r\\nV: In The Walls\\r\\nRobert gets a ride with a Mr. Jenkins to Manchester, New Hampshire, where he intends to visit Saint Anselm College to read its copy of the Kitab. He\\'s shown around the college by Father Walter Race, who tells him there are government agents in the area investigating a fallen meteorite. He also meets an assistant from the medical department, Hector North, who invites him to stay with him and his \\'friend\\', James Montague, if he fails to find lodgings in Goffs Falls. On the way to find lodgings, Robert meets a precociously intelligent 13-year-old named Elspeth, who suggests he try Mrs. Macey\\'s boarding house. Robert rents a room there, then visits Agent Frank Stubbs and his men, who are investigating where the meteorite came down. Going to bed that night, Robert experiences terrifying nightmares involving Mrs. Macey and a rat-like version of Mr. Jenkins. He packs his bags and goes to Hector North\\'s house, unaware of his new danger.\\r\\n\\r\\nVI: Out Of Time\\r\\nRobert wakes from bad dreams, and James cooks breakfast for him and Hector. James and Hector argue over Hector\\'s desire to kill Robert and reanimate him, but Robert mistakes their bickering for James being sexually jealous. Elspeth delivers a message from the college to their front door, which alarms James and Hector enough that they pack and leave town immediately. Elspeth walks Robert back to the college and suggests they meet again later. Father Race takes Robert to meet Dr. Henry Wantage, who guides him to the library and shows him a photograph of the members of Stella Sapiente, which includes the late Edgar Wade, Elspeth\\'s father. Robert reads the Kitab, and his perception of time becomes distorted. He parts company with Wantage and finds Elspeth waiting for him. She takes him back to her lodgings, where the Being that possesses Elspeth swaps bodies with Robert and rapes him in Elspeth\\'s body. Afterward, the Being swaps bodies back again and \"Elspeth\" sends a traumatized Robert on his way. Running through the rain, a car passes Robert in which he can see Mr. Jenkins driving him into Manchester for the first time.\\r\\n\\r\\nVII: The Picture\\r\\nRobert finds himself in the middle of a riot during the Boston Police Strike. An off-duty policeman, Eamon O\\'Brien, shows him to the home of artist and photographer, Ronald Underwood Pitman, who took the photograph of the members of Stella Sapiente at Saint Anselm College. O\\'Brien stays for a drink and Pitman puts up Robert for the night. The next day, Pitman reveals some of the identities of the people in the photograph to Robert. Robert catches a glimpse of one of Pitman\\'s horrific paintings of ghouls attacking commuters on a subway, and Pitman offers to show him his \"technique\" in the hope it will make Robert better understand his perilous situation. He takes him down to his basement and introduces him to a ghoul called King George. Afterward, Robert convinces himself that Pitman has merely demonstrated the same form of hypnotic suggestion which he believes Elspeth must have used on him. Pitman realizes he\\'s failed to make Robert understand the truth and suggests he visit local author Randall Carver, whom he hopes might do a better job. Robert bids him farewell and heads on his way. Pitman goes into his dark room and develops a photograph of three ghouls posing with the dead body of O\\'Brien.\\r\\n\\r\\nVIII: The Key\\r\\nRobert has spent several weeks staying with Randall Carver discussing the relationship between dreams and art. He has also discovered, in an amateur publication called Pine Cones, a writer of weird fiction he particularly admires named H. P. Lovecraft. Carver demonstrates to Robert the power of dreams by taking him into the Dreamlands, where they meet a group of cats who carry them up towards the Moon before they are snatched and dropped by a flock of Nightgaunts. On waking, Carver takes Robert to attend a literary event with Lord Dunsany as its guest speaker. To Robert\\'s delight, one of the other attendees is none other than Lovecraft himself. The unwitting Robert introduces himself to Lovecraft, and it becomes ominously apparent that their meeting has been pre-ordained by dark forces.\\r\\n\\r\\nIX: Outsiders\\r\\nRobert arrives in Providence to meet Henry Annesley, a scientist who has developed a pair of spectacles through which he can see extra-dimensional organisms which overlap our plane of reality. Annesley, a member of Stella Sapiente, tells Robert some of the group\\'s history, and introduces him to Howard Charles, a young genealogist. Annesley observes that Robert and Howard Charles are attracted to each other, and suggests Howard show Robert some of the local landmarks associated with the \"Stell Saps\". Howard takes Robert to St. John\\'s Church, where occult meetings were once held in the steeple. They go inside and discover a shining trapezohedron in a box, in fact the very same meteorite that fell to Earth in Manchester. Howard seduces Robert, and they have sex while looking into the alien stone. Afterwards, Robert calls on Lovecraft at his home. Lovecraft helps Robert find lodgings, and then Robert accompanies him to visit his mother in the mental hospital. Robert waits while Lovecraft sees his mother and pretends not to overhear their exchange. Lovecraft rejoins him and they depart. Lovecraft\\'s mother looks on after them and sees the same weird creatures in the air that Annesley does through his spectacles.\\r\\n\\r\\nX: The Haunted Palace\\r\\nRobert and Lovecraft discuss how Lord Dunsany and Edgar Allan Poe influenced Lovecraft\\'s early work, and Lovecraft admits that reading about Robert\\'s strange experiences in his commonplace book has inspired him further. Robert\\'s liking for Lovecraft evaporates when he expresses both his homophobia and antisemitism, and soon realizes that the unwitting Lovecraft\\'s father, Winfield Scott Lovecraft, and maternal grandfather, Whipple Van Buren Phillips, were both members of Stella Sapiente. Believing that Lovecraft has been ordained by the occult group to be their \\'Redeemer\\', Robert panics and returns to his lodgings. He writes a letter to Tom Malone, in which he warns him about everything he has discovered on his travels, unaware that the steeple window of St. John\\'s Church appears to be getting nearer and nearer his own. Suddenly, Johnny Carcosa (an avatar of Nyarlathotep) appears in the room and confirms that Robert has helped to fulfill a prophecy in which Lovecraft\\'s stories will bring about the apocalypse. In gratitude, Carcosa kneels before Robert and fellates him.\\r\\n\\r\\nXI: The Unnameable\\r\\nRobert takes the train back to New York and mails the letter to Malone before going to commit suicide in the same Lethal Chamber as his former lover, Jonathan. Lovecraft\\'s career gains momentum and all his stories merge with reality: Malone goes mad after the events of The Horror at Red Hook; Lovecraft marries; the events of The Dunwich Horror, The Case of Charles Dexter Ward, The Thing on the Doorstep and The Shadow Over Innsmouth play out; Lovecraft makes the acquaintance of August Derleth; Robert E. Howard shoots himself; Lovecraft dies and Derleth becomes his executor rather than Robert Barlow; in the 1970s, hippies discover Lovecraft\\'s work; the Kitab is marketed as the \"real\" Necronomicon; belief in the occult power of the Necronomicon spreads; Cthulhu plushies go on sale. Then the events of The Courtyard and Neonomicon come to pass... and then the Cthulian apocalypse begins.\\r\\n\\r\\nXII: The Book\\r\\nAt the FBI, Carl Perlman concludes that all Lovecraft\\'s fiction, its criticism and Robert\\'s testament have acted as the conduit through which an outside force has taken purchase on humanity\\'s collective unconscious to a point where it can change reality. Word has reached the FBI that a pregnant-looking Merril Brears has sprung Aldo Sax from his asylum, and Perlman wonders if they might find them at Saint Anselm College. He drives to Manchester but instead finds himself in \\'Lovecraft Country\\'. At Miskatonic University, he learns that Brears and Sax have been and gone, and taken the Kitab with them. Continuing on foot to Arkham, he finds a delegation waiting which includes Brears, Sax, some Mi-Go, a woman \\'housing\\' a member of the Great Race of Yith and Lovecraftian scholar S. T. Joshi. In the sky above them floats Azathoth. Carcosa appears, and Brears goes into labour, giving birth to the infant Cthulhu. Carcosa sets the babe into the river as Brears, Perlman and Joshi look on from the bridge. Perlman wonders if there\\'s anything in Robert\\'s commonplace book that might help them reverse the situation, but Brears and Joshi are skeptical. As Shub-Niggurath glides slowly towards the place where they\\'re standing, Perlman rips the book in half and scatters its pages into the water.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublication history\\r\\nAlan Moore heavily researched the series; in a six-month period he acquired \"nearly every book of [Lovecraft] criticism that’s been written\".\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what Providence is, is an attempt to write—at least, my attempt to write what I would consider to be a piece of ultimate Lovecraft fiction, in that it will be fiction, it will be a continuation of Neonomicon, it will in a sense be a prequel to that book, but it will also—slightly—be a sequel as well.

Sequart.', 'Ernst Immanuel Cohen Brandes (1 February 1844 – 6 August 1892) was a Danish economist, writer, and newspaper editor. He is best known for editing the Kjøbenhavns Børs-Tidende, which published articles written by leading Danish men of letters, including future Nobel Prize winner Henrik Pontoppidan, during a period later hailed as the Modern Breakthrough in Danish literature.\\r\\nOutraged by his politicized blasphemy conviction for an article anonymously written by Pontoppidan for the Kjøbenhavns Børs-Tidende in 1889, Brandes committed suicide in 1892.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nErnst Brandes was born to a Danish Jewish family in Copenhagen on 1 February 1844, two years after his elder brother Georg Brandes and three years before the youngest, Edvard.\\r\\nTrained as an economist, Brandes focused much of his time on economic and social questions. In his 1885 Samfundssporgsmaal, he attacked the population theories of Thomas Malthus and the theory of value advanced by David Ricardo. Though prominent as a social liberal, Brandes reserved part of Samfundssporgsmaal for a critique of the Marxist movement.\\r\\nBrandes came to write for the Politiken, which Edvard had helped to found in 1884, before editing his own newspaper, the Kjøbenhavns Børs-Tidende, in 1889 – an idiosyncratic undertaking meant to combine stock price lists and radical literature. Successful in his efforts to attract a wide range of talented writers, Brandes published the literary efforts and social commentary of such authors as Johannes Jørgensen, Sophus Claussen, and Viggo Stuckenberg. Having met Henrik Pontoppidan through Edvard, Brandes encouraged the outstanding Danish writer to join. Pontoppidan, who later recalled Brandes saying that Brandes\\' idea for the Kjøbenhavns Børs-Tidende was to create a modern, entertaining opposition paper capable of challenging the established conservative press in the Danish capital, agreed to collaborate and joined the Børs-Tidende on 30 July 1889. His ideas were anonymously published in a regular column written under the pseudonym \"Urbanus\".\\r\\nBrandes\\' 1889 publication of \"Messias\" and the 1890 publication \"Den gamle Adam\" – two pieces penned by Pontoppidan under his pseudonym – triggered a scandalous reaction. \"Den gamle Adam\" was a light-hearted version of the Biblical story of Adam and Eve inspired by an old German folk retelling; \"Messias\" was Pontoppidan\\'s review of a book by Viggo Stuckenberg.\\r\\nIndicted on blasphemy charges for both pieces in December 1890, Brandes was made to answer for each as distinct offenses against the blasphemy laws before a jury trial. He was acquitted for \"Den gamle Adam\" but ordered to serve two months for the publication of the \"Messias\" article. Pontoppidan, who was not charged, admitted he was the author of the two articles when the matter was brought to trial, but faced no penalty despite his admission and his offer to claim legal responsibility in Brandes\\' place. The defense argued that Brandes was being singled out as a prominent Brandes brother and a person of Jewish background.\\r\\nThe controversial case finally made its way to the Danish Supreme Court, which again acquitted Brandes for the Adam article but upheld the conviction for \"Messias\" while softening the earlier sentence of two months\\' imprisonment to a fine of 300 kroner in December 1891.\\r\\nDespondent for months afterward, he committed suicide by taking poison in Copenhagen on 6 August 1892.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n1886 lecture by Ernst Brandes on Henry George Archived 2011-07-17 at the Wayback Machine (in Danish)\\r\\nErnst Brandes\\' letters to Henrik Pontoppidan (in Danish)\\r\\nEntry on Brandes at JewishEncyclopedia.com', 'Anhelo Hernández Ríos (21 November 1922 – 11 March 2010) was a Uruguayan plastic artist and teacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nAnhelo Hernández Ríos was born on 21 November 1922, the son of María Ríos and José Hernández.

Nuorteva emigrated to the United States in 1911 and played a leading role in the sizable Finnish-language socialist movement in America. At various times, he edited the magazines S�keni� (\"The Spark\") and the newspapers Toveri (\"The Comrade\") and Raivaaja (\"The Pioneer\"). He was the official spokesman in America for the Finnish Socialist Revolutionary government of 1918 and, after its overthrow, was influential in the official affairs of the government of Soviet Russia in the United States. In 1920, he was deported to Soviet Russia.\\r\\nHis daughter was the famous Finnish-Soviet spy Kerttu Nuorteva.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nSanteri was named Alexander Nyberg when he was born in Viipuri, Grand Duchy of Finland, on June 29, 1881. His father, Claes Fredrik Nyberg, was a telegraph officer and his mother was the Russian Jewish-born Anna Aleksandrovna Saharova. Even before graduating from high school, Santeri had been working in a shop and as a seaman and boilerman. After graduating high school in 1904, he started to work as a teacher and journalist in Forssa. He was a language teacher at the Forssa primary school in 1904 to 1907 and editor of the Forssa News in 1904 to 1906.\\r\\nAfter leaving Forssa, Nuorteva worked as journalist for the magazine Socialist in Turku in 1908 and then as editor of the magazine Kansan in Tampere in 1909 to 1911. Nuorteva was imprisoned for l�se majest�  in 1909.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical career\\r\\nNyberg fennicized his name to Santeri Nuorteva in 1906, during the period of the Revolution of 1905 in the Russian Empire, which included Finland. He became a member of the Finnish Parliament in 1907 and served there until 1910.\\r\\nNuorteva immigrated to the United States in 1911, where he instantly became a leading member of the Finnish Socialist Federation in America and one of its most prominent spokesmen. He worked as editor of the daily newspaper Toveri (\"The Comrade\") in Astoria, Oregon, in the Pacific Northwest from 1912 to 1913. He left for the East coast to edit the monthly magazine S�keni� (\"The Spark\") and worked on the editorial staff of Raivaaja (\"The Pioneer\").\\r\\nDuring the Finnish Civil War, Nuorteva was the charg� d\\'affaires of the Finnish Socialist Workers\\' Republic in Washington, DC, in 1918 to 1919. On May 10, 1918, when the government that Nuorteva represented had been overthrown, an audience of socialists filled New York City\\'s Carnegie Hall to hear him denounce the Finnish anti-Bolsheviks as allies of the German Junker class and not friends of America and its allies, as they claimed. Implicitly defending the recent Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which marked Soviet Russia\\'s exit from the war against Germany, he hailed the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia as the greatest threat to Germany: \"Today the Socialist Republic flag of Russia floats over a Socialist embassy in Berlin, a terrible symbol of the greatest menace to the German rulers, for this flag represents the power of a great popular idea that involves the complete destruction of kaiserism and junkerdom and all their works.\" He campaigned for US diplomatic recognition of the Soviet government.\\r\\nOn September 21, 1918, the New York Evening Post charged that he was the author and fabricator of the Sisson Documents, a controversial set of Russian-language papers that, if genuine, proved that the German General Staff had financed the Russian Revolution and that both Lenin and Trotsky were German agents. Eventually, he became the information chief of the Russian Information Bureau, the de facto embassy of the Russian government, in 1919 to 1920, as assistant to Ludwig Martens, the unrecognized Soviet ambassador and a controversial figure in America.\\r\\nIn 1918, he also collaborated on a translation into English of Lenin\\'s \"Letter to American Workers.\"\\r\\nIn 1920, Nuorteva left the United States by traveling first to Canada and then to England, where he was deported after 10 days to Soviet Russia, the destination that he requested, rather than a return to the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoviet years\\r\\nBack in Soviet Russia, Nuorteva was made the head of the Anglo-American Division of the People\\'s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs.\\r\\nIn the Soviet Union, Nuorteva was again briefly arrested and jailed in 1921 to 1922. After his release, he worked as the manager in the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in Petroskoi in 1922.\\r\\nAfter he returned to Moscow, Nuorteva worked as a journalist and as the commissar of Anglo-American department in Moscow in 1923 to 1924, when\\r\\nRosta, the Soviet news agency, sent Nuorteva for a short time to Stockholm as its representative. After working there, Nuorteva became the chairman of the Soviet Karelian Central Committee in 1924 to 1927.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath and legacy\\r\\nNuorteva died on March 31, 1929, in Leningrad while he worked for the editor of the Soviet dictionary.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nFinnish Socialist Federation\\r\\nSocialist Party of Oregon\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nWorks by or about Santeri Nuorteva at Internet Archive', \"Claude Lafortune (5 July 1936 – 19 April 2020) was a Canadian paper artist, set decorator, and television personality.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nA graduate of the École des beaux-arts de Montréal, Lafortune collaborated on many graphic design projects before he became famous for his paper art.\\r\\nHe had an exhibit devoted to his paper art work—titled Colle, papier, ciseaux—at the Musée des cultures du monde in Nicolet, Quebec.

Fernández (December 7, 1925 – March 13, 1986) was a Cuban artist, photographer, and photojournalist. He was an art director of Visión Magazine in New York City and a photographer for the Revolución newspaper in Havana, Cuba. Fernández was granted the Cintas Foundation Fellowship for painting in 1967 and 1975.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nJesse Antonio Fernández was born in Havana, Cuba on December 7, 1925. He and his family moved to Asturias, Spain in the late 1920s to escape the repressive leadership of Cuban leader Gerardo Machado. They returned to Cuba in December 1936 to escape the Spanish Civil War. In 1942, Fernández left for Philadelphia to study electronic engineering. In 1945, he returned to Cuba, and devoted himself to painting. In 1947, Fernández returned the United States, settling in New York City. He registered with the Art Students League, where he studied painting with George Grosz and Preston Dickinson. In 1948, Fernández met painter Wifredo Lam, who introduced him to several European painters living in New York City at the time, including Marcel Duchamp and Esteban Francés. In 1949, Fernández\\'s daughter Yolanda was born in New York City. In 1952, Fernández travelled to Medellin, Colombia, where he was influenced to begin studying photography. In 1954, Fernández worked for Propaganda Epoca, a Colombian advertising agency, where he met Fernando Botero and Gabriel Garcia Márquez.\\r\\nIn 1955, Fernández travelled the Amazonian area of El Atrato, studying archaeology and ethnology. After photographing Native Americans in Guajira for four months, he returned to New York City, where he sold many of the photographs he had taken in South America. In 1957, he took part as a photographer in the filming of Nazarín de Luis Buñuel in Mexico. His photographs were published in Life, Esquire, Paris Match, Jours of France, Pageant, Cosmopolitan, Evergreen Review, Time Magazine, The New York Times, and the Herald Tribune. In 1958, Fernández accepted the artistic director position for Visión magazine, for which he traveled to Ecuador, Mexico, and Central America. He also worked as a photographer for the Revolución newspaper and its weekly magazine, the Lunes of Revolución, photographing writers, musicians, and artists, including José Lezama Lima and Ernest Hemingway. During this time period he traveled to Havana on a yearly basis to see his family. During one of these trips, he wrote a report on the artistic life of Cuba for Life Magazine. In 1960, he returned to New York City and temporarily gave up photography to devote himself to painting, teaching at the School Visual Arts. He lived in the “Village”, regularly meeting with Jorge Luis Borges, Aldous Huxley, Joan Miró, Antoni Tàpies, and Antonio Will. In 1961, his work was exhibited at the D’Arcy Gallery of New York.\\r\\nIn 1969, he started to alternate his work in New York with stays in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in search of an environment more favorable to creation. During this period he wrote as an art critic for several publications, including the San Juan Star, Opus International, and Knowledge of Arts. From 1971 to 1973, his works were exhibited at the El Morro gallery in San Juan, the museum of the University of Puerto Rico, and at the Alliance Fran1caise and Botello gallery in San Juan. Between 1974 and 1976, he lived in the Spanish cities of Toledo and Madrid. In the late 1970s and early 1980s he took part in several exhibitions, including the Basel Art Fair 76, one at the Ynguanzo gallery of Madrid, “One Jackson Pollock” at the American Arts center of Paris, “Siete Años” at the Theo gallery of Madrid, one at the American Arts center of Madrid, and another at the Museum of Contemporary art in Caracas, Venezuela.\\r\\nHe died in Paris, France, on March 13, 1986.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegacy\\r\\nFernández\\'s work was included in Caras y máscaras, exhibited at Galería 8 in 1983 and at Miami Dade Community College in 1988. In 1993, Cintas Fellows Revisited: A Decade After was shown at the Main Library of the Metro Dade Cultural Center in Miami, Florida. The same year, his work was included in Photography by Cintas Fellows, which was exhibited at The Art Museum of the Florida International University in Miami.\\r\\nIn 2003, the National Museum of Art Reina Sofia in Madrid held a retrospective of his photographs, drawings, and cajas (boxes) from June to September.

Originally a career officer and Orientalist in service to the Russian Empire, he was dispatched to the Far East, in Vladivostok and Khabarovsk, seeing action in the Russo-Japanese War. He was wounded and shielded from active duty, but returned with the start of World War I, managing to survive the Battle of Tannenberg. By the time of the February Revolution, he was a civil servant in Bessarabia, and an affiliate of the Octobrist Party.\\r\\nLater in 1917, Cijevschi was active within the ethnic Romanian political movement, being increasingly supportive of Romanian nationalism as espoused by the National Moldavian Party; as president of the Soldiers\\' Congress, he mapped out a plan for Bessarabia\\'s emancipation, and fought against the influence of leftist factions, Esers and Bolsheviks alike. On this platform, he joined the regional assembly, called Sfatul Țării, as well as the executive leadership of the Moldavian Democratic Republic. As the government-appointed Commissar, Cijevschi helped organize defense against leftist insurrection, but denounce Bolshevik infiltration of the Bessarabian troops, which had compromised his plan for action. Ultimately supportive of the Romanian military expedition, he contributed decisively to the Bessarabian–Romanian union in March 1918. He then drifted away from the mainstream nationalist platform, establishing his own National-Democratic Party, and then affiliating with Vladimir Herța\\'s short-lived Romanian League.\\r\\nCijevschi was much upset with the centralizing policies of Greater Romania, and in particular with the dissolution of Sfatul—though he continued to work as a civil administrator, and joined the mainstream People\\'s Party, as well as, briefly, the Romanian National Party. Turning to Russian-language journalism, and earning reputation as a polemicist and alleged blackmailer, he is also remembered for his endorsement of Bessarabian identity within Romania, while also still frequenting the nationalist club ASTRA. His critics were alarmed by what they saw as \"anti-Romanian\" activities, and circulated allegations that he was cultivating known communists. A man of literary and scholarly ambitions, during the early interwar period Cijevschi was a patron of the Bessarabian Art Academy. His various projects were cut short by his death at age 50, reportedly caused by a combination of his old war wounds and disease.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nEarly life and career\\r\\nCijevschi was a native of Zaim village, Bender County, at the geographical center of Bessarabia Governorate. In a 1918 record of all Sfatul Țării members, his nationality was indicated as \"Moldavian\"—a term used in that paper for all the ethnic Romanian or Romanian-speaking delegates; military historian Anatol Munteanu refers to his family as being \"Moldavian Romanian\", noting that Vasile\\'s ancestors were priests—of the Russian Orthodox Church—who had amassed a sizable family fortune. Activist Romulus Cioflec, who met Cijevschi in late 1917, recalls that he spoke \"a poorly mastered, minimal but clean, Romanian language\" (o românească greu mânuită și săracă, dar curată). His birth date was October 17, 1880, though some records suggest 1881. Young Vasile was initially destined for a career in the Orthodox clergy, and enlisted at the Bessarabian Theological Seminary. He befriended Ion Pelivan, the emerging leader of Bessarabian Romanians; in June 1898, they heard songs by the \"great patriot and true spiritual parent\", Dionisie Erhan, at the monastery of Suruceni.\\r\\nCijevschi never graduated, preferring to enlist in the Cadet Corps. In 1902, he completed training at a cavalry school in Yelisavetgrad, Kherson Governorate, and was dispatched for guard duty on the Sea of Japan coastline (Primorskaya Oblast), at Vladivostok and Khabarovsk. He reached the rank of Rotmistr (Captain). He was involved in the Russo-Japanese War, when he also received academic training in Oriental studies and prepared for a career in Russian diplomacy. By 1905, he was fighting in Manchuria, where he happened to meet a fellow Bessarabian soldier, Ștefan Usinevici. The latter wrote to Pelivan that October: \"I never again ran into Cijevschi, and possibly never will, for such things are now quite impossible, my brother.\" Caught up in a series of losing battles, Cijevschi was badly injured, and moved back into European Russia—advancing to battalion commander with the official rank of Major, he was honorably discharged on April 16, 1911. He was again called to arms upon the outbreak of World War I in mid 1914, the year which also marked his graduation as a philologist from Saint Petersburg State University. Assigned to the 2nd Army on the Eastern Front, he managed to survive its destruction at Tannenberg. He was allowed to regain civilian life in Bessarabia, settling in Khishinev (Chișinău) as an employee of the local Zemstvo (local government body).\\r\\nCijevschi turned to politics during the February Revolution of 1917, originally as a member of the Party of State Order (Octobrists). In April, he was registered as one of six Bessarabian envoys to the Congress of Russian Peoples of the Ukrainian People\\'s Republic, where he prospected the emancipation of Romanians living under nominal Ukrainian rule. Cijevschi\\'s turn to Romanian nationalism was observed by fellow activist Grigore Cazacliu, whom Cijevschi visited in Iași, on the Romanian Front, at some point in mid 1917. As Cazacliu notes: \"he pledged his body and his soul to our cause, namely the action for setting free our Bessarabia.\" As noted by historian Ion Țurcanu, Cijevschi \"enjoyed the admiration of Moldavian nationalist combatants\", becoming \"one of the most educated [and] most influential\" among them; the resulting National Moldavian Party elected him as one of the chief delegates. By September 1917, Cijevschi was also involved with the Moldavian Congress of Chișinău, which called for Bessarabian autonomy within the Russian Republic. This institution elected Cijevschi as Commissar for Bessarabia, but, despite the efforts of Bessarabian lobbyists, his appointment was never sanctioned by the Russian Army Command in Mogilev. \\r\\nShortly after the October Revolution, Cijevschi helped establish the All-Russian Congress of Moldavian Soldiers, functioning as the first legislative and executive body of Bessarabian autonomists. He was elected President of that Congress, with Ștefan Holban serving as his secretary. As noted by Cioflec, this event witnessed the \"most impressive moment\" in the development of Romanian nationalism in Bessarabia: Cijevschi\\'s speeches in Romanian alternated with renditions of patriotic songs (including Deșteaptă-te, române! and Pe-al nostru steag e scris Unire), while the attending crowds waved variants of the Romanian tricolor. It was here that, in early November, the Major presented other delegates with the political options that resulted from self-determination—autonomy, (con)federation, and a unitary independent state. Cijevschi also issued orders for applying the ethnic criterion in education, setting aside funds for the \"nationalization\" of Bessarabian schools, and reprimanding the authorities of Akerman County for resisting this trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the 1918 union struggle\\r\\nConfronting the groups of radicalized soldiers, especially the Esers and Bolsheviks, Cijevschi also drafted the first plans for a regional parliament and a Bessarabian military. Both he and Holban signed their names to a Congress proclamation on self-determination, which became legal precedent in the Moldavian Democratic Republic. Following the legislative election of 1917, Cijevschi became a representative of Bender in the new regional assembly, called Sfatul Țării; his mandate officially began on the opening day of November 21, 1917, and saw him mainly active on the Legal and Drafting Commissions. As Pelivan recalls, the Major organized the opening festivities, which saw him reviewing the first Bessarabian troops and planting a Romanian tricolor on the Sfatul Palace. Within this legislature, he also presided upon an all-Romanian faction, the \"Moldavian Bloc\", which rivaled other ethnic community parties. On November 23, the Republic appointed Cijevschi Commissar of the Bessarabian army, which was engaged in the effort to contain Bolshevik rebellion. The office had been created on his own suggestion. Upon taking over, he applied his own philosophy for recruitment: instead of creating an all-Romanian military structure, he gave a significant share to members of all ethnic communities. One late report by soldier Dimitrie Bogos notes that Cijevschi\\'s aide-de-camp, Vasile Țanțu, was in charge during November, when the Commissar was incapacitated by disease.\\r\\nThe seriousness of the turmoil created by Russian deserters was underscored on December 2, when Sfatul established a Commission to Combat Anarchy. Its members were Cijevschi, Țanțu, Vladimir Cristi, and Valentin Prahnițchi. The undertrained republican army could not ultimately deal with the raids carried out by Russian deserters, and Cijevschi resigned his commission on December 22; the position itself had been made redundant by the creation of a Military Directorate. On December 7, he was also integrated with the Foreign Directorate as an undersecretary of state, and, later that month, visited the Romanian Kingdom. He reportedly obtained an audience with King Ferdinand I in Iași, presenting him a message on behalf of the Directorate. Cijevschi also returned to the legislative assembly, where, on January 31, he voiced his opinion that the Bessarabian militias had been \"infected by the Bolshevik poison\", proposing that they be dissolved (as noted in March by his Sfatul colleague Vasile Harea, he also proposed their absorption by the Romanian Army).\\r\\nCijevschi soon became involved in debates with ethnic minority delegates over the adoption of Romanian as the Republic\\'s official language. In February, he was assigned to an editorial committee for Sfatul\\'s eponymous newspaper, transitioning it from a Romanian-titled publication in Russian to an all-Romanian sheet. Also that month, the paper hosted one of his own articles, with which he welcomed the creation of a Moldavian cultural society, Făclia. The piece also featured his instructions to Bessarabian intellectuals that they should combat Bolshevik agitation among the peasants. On March 14, signalling the Moldavian majority\\'s steady accommodation of Romanian nationalism, Cijevschi was among the deputies who obtained that Pushkin Hall be assigned to Făclia, which had pledged itself to the creation of a Romanian-language theater. Ten days later, he welcomed in Chișinău Constantin Stere, the Bessarabian émigré and senior anti-Russian revolutionary, who had come to champion the project of merging Bessarabia with Romania. Nationalist scholar Onisifor Ghibu, who was a witness to the event, argues that Cijevschi was already more right-wing than Stere: his speech indicated that \"a state\\'s existence should be based on national sentiment, rather than on the Russian concept of the state.\" Stere replied that the Russian Republic was still a decent political model, and claimed to read Cijevschi\\'s message as one of \"love between Bessarabia\\'s peoples\"; according to Ghibu: \"Mr Stere was refusing to even take note of the Bessarabian intelligentsia\\'s nationalist orientation\".\\r\\nAt the height of a Romanian military intervention in Bessarabia, Cijevschi\\'s Sfatul Țării campaigning helped swing the vote in favor of union with Romania—as proclaimed by the legislative body on April 9, 1918. Sfatul had hosted the Prime Minister of Romania, Alexandru Marghiloman, who had pleaded for unification, promising in return that Bessarabia would receive the universal male suffrage and a sweeping land reform, while Sfatul would be preserved as the regional assembly. Cijevschi was himself enthusiastic about that bargain, and \"held a long and fiery speech in Romanian\", pleading with his colleagues that Bessarabia now had an \"extraordinary historic opportunity\" of twinning national emancipation with social justice. Within Sfatul, he canvassed for an open ballot, which ensured transparency, and therefore also legitimacy. He was also the one to read the act of union in its Russian translation. On the same day, he initiated Stere\\'s election as honorary deputy for Soroca.\\r\\n\\r\\nAutonomist advocacy\\r\\nIn the newly unified country, Cijevschi split with the Moldavian Bloc and, on May 14, created his own parliamentary party, called \"National-Democratic Party\". According to Țurcanu, the reasons for this change of direction \"are insufficiently known\"—though they relate to the fact that Cijevschi, like Nicolae Alexandri, Pantelimon Erhan, and Ion Păscăluță, had only endorsed union with a preservation of regional self-rule. Overall, Cijevschi, a man of \"great conceit\", seemed \"partly detached from the ideals which inspired the more enthusiastic Bessarabian fighters, when it came to the full affirmation of the Romanians\\' national rights\", as well as \"dispassionate\" about the Bloc\\'s projected land reform. According to Munteanu: \"He had a particular idea as to the independence that should have been granted to Bessarabia within a Greater Romania, with the boyars\\' land destined for handing out to peasants and to soldiers who had fought in the various wars.\"\\r\\nA new Romanian administration, under Prime Minister Ion I. C. Brătianu, took over in late 1918, introducing centralizing legislation and De-Russification. Cijevschi now openly supported a return to regional autonomy: with Alexandri, Păscăluță, Vasile Ghenzul, and several other Sfatul members, he issued a formal protest against the state of siege and demanded the reintroduction of Russia\\'s Civil Code. Their memorandum was welcomed by the White émigré communities, who took it as proof that Bessarabia was still loyal to the defunct Russian Empire. Cijevschi\\'s parliamentary mandate expired on November 27, 1918. In 1919, he began popularizing his views by means of his own Russian-language newspaper, Golos Kishinyova. In April of that year, he joined the Romanian League, formed around the conservative Vladimir Herța; it attempted to mount opposition to the more left-wing Bessarabian Peasants\\' Party (PȚB), but finally presented no candidates in the general election of November 1919 (except in Cahul County). Ion Inculeț, the former Moldavian President, was critical of the League. Seeing it as a venue for splitting the nationalist vote, he concluded: \"It cannot have ties within the people, since it is made up of landowners.\" As an exponent of the Bessarabian conservative caucus, Vasile Stroescu admired the League for \"[saying] that land reform, in its existing shape, is nothing but land-theft\".\\r\\nAfter this episode, Cijevschi withdrew from national politics. As argued by Țurcanu, he was partly validated in feeling \"disgusted\" by the corruption of Brătianu and other Romanian politicians. Still involved with the Moldavian Veterans\\' Association, and employed for a while by the Chișinău Community Bank, he worked mainly as a civil servant for the Mayor of Chișinău, supervising the local schools. As a speaker of \"Oriental languages\", he was asked to review the archeological finds at Galilești, but could not read the mysterious inscriptions. His activity was primarily focused on the Art Academy, which he helped refurbish. Under his watch as head of the local Fine Arts Society (1921–1926), the school was presided upon by sculptor Alexandru Plămădeală; it employed educators who were frowned upon in Romania for their alleged Bolshevik sympathies. During the 1920s Cijevschi rallied with the People\\'s Party, and edited its regional Russian-language newspaper, Nashe Slovo (\"Our Word\"). \\r\\nTransnistrian academic Piotr Șornikov sees Cijevschi as \"one of the founders of the Bessarabian autonomist movement\", in turn located on the \"moderate wing of the Bessarabian liberation movement\" and connected to the notion of Moldavian ethnic distinctiveness. According to a report put out in September 1922 by Adevărul daily, Cijevschi was in fact a political associate of Inculeț, who ended up aligning himself with Brătianu\\'s governing National Liberals; this affiliation also allowed Cijevschi to maintain his position within Chișinău\\'s city government—effectively, as the unelected Vice Mayor. Physician I. Duscian made similar claims in Universul paper, adding allegations that Cijevschi was forcing inmates of public orphanages to only speak Russian. In October 1923, activist Ion Negoiescu alleged that Cijevschi had become a political client of the Romanian National Party, which was relying on him to build a regional chapter. According to Negoiescu, this was unacceptable, since Cijevschi, in addition to being \"anti-Romanian\", had a \"penchant for belonging to several political parties at the same time\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal scandals, illness, and death\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Nashe Slovo team mounted attacks on a local Senator, Iosif Sanielevici, who responded in the rival paper, Novoye Slovo, allegedly calling Cijevschi a blackmailer and a hooligan. Cijevschi had asked for Sanielevici to be tried as a libeler, but his request was denied by the local prosecutor; according to Adevărul, this was the government\\'s way of suggesting that Sanielevici was right about Cijevschi. In October 1924, Inculeț, as the titular Minister for Bessarabia, lifted a temporary ban on the Russian-language newspapers by allowing Cijevschi to put out the daily Bessarabskaya Mysl. Universul was critical of this decision, calling attention to his autonomist stances. It also noted that the two other editors were Constantin Mâțu, previously employed by \"Bolshevik gazettes\", and Viktor Yakubovich, who had championed Russian imperialism. Cijevschi was also editor of the newspaper Nasha Mysl (1924–1925), but, according to claims aired by Universul, its actual managers were two prominent figures of the National Liberal caucus in Chișinău: Erhan and Vitalie Zubac. According to Universul sources, the party was paying Cijevschi a daily salary of 2,000 lei in exchange for editorial control.\\r\\nOn December 7, 1924, the Sanielevici scandal was taken to the Russian Journalists\\' Syndicate, with most members reportedly positioning themselves against Cijevschi, whom they depicted as a tool of the deposed Mayor, Vasile Bârcă, and an immoral \"Hottentot\". Cijevschi had by then established another tribune, Bessarabskaya Zhizn, and was involved as head editor of two other publications: Gazeta-Lei and Ghibu\\'s România Nouă. The latter activity also came with Cijevschi\\'s recruitment by Ghibu\\'s nationalist club, ASTRA, whose ideas he helped spread in Bessarabia. After September 1924, he was reviving his critique of the National Liberals, voicing his defense of Tatarbunary insurgents. In January 1928, on the tenth anniversary of the Moldavian Democratic Republic\\'s independence, he spoke about the need for a \"large-scale decentralization\" in all Romanian and European regions. He and Cristi appeared alongside their centralizing rivals, including in official photographs of the events—indicating to Țurcanu that their support of autonomy had never turned into full-blown secessionism. \\r\\nOn February 27, 1929, Cijevschi was interviewed by Alexandru Terziman for Dimineața daily, criticizing the National Liberal authorities for still maintaining the state of siege. He assessed that there was no real threat of a communist insurgency, since the region\\'s core population were \"Moldavian peasants, gentle and hard-working\"; in his view, the Romanian public was wrong to demand a ban on Chișinău\\'s Russian-language press, noting that local Russian newspaper were generally anti-communist. He also warned that social turmoil could result from a prolonged administrative abuse, and demanded for a \"good an honest administration\", with power devolved to a regional government. Around then, Cijevschi was editorial secretary of Bessarabskoye Slovo, a Russian-language daily put out by Daniel Ciugureanu. Its publication was followed with concern by Romania\\'s secret police, the Siguranța, which made note that one of Cijevschi\\'s employees, Simon Ocner, had been sentenced as a Soviet spy; the report also assessed that Bessarabskoye Slovo had a readership of 40,000, many of whom were Russophiles and Bessarabian Jews. During his final decade, Cijevschi dabbled in fiction writing: the short story Unei prietene (\"To a Lady Friend\") was published by Viața Basarabiei magazine in 1934, allowing readers to discover him as a \"subtle writer of prose.\" \\r\\nThe former Commissar died on July 14, 1931, and was buried at the \"Armenesc\" Central Orthodox Cemetery, Chișinău. Aged 50, he was reportedly killed by \"war wounds and some incurable diseases\". One of Pelivan\\'s manuscripts, which responds to Soviet claims that Sfatul\\'s deputies had been bought off, notes: \"the leaders of the Moldavian Bloc—Vasile Cijevschi and Vasile Tanțu—have lived and died in squalor.\" As noted in October 1932 by journalist Romulus Dianu, Cijevschi had become an \"obscure hero of the Union [...], not granted any honors when he was performing his deeds, nor when he was being laid to rest in that ground he had brought to life\". In 1934, a portrait done in bas-relief by Plămădeală was added as decoration to his grave, following a request from his widow; the work was encased in a slab of granite, very similar to the one topping Plămădeală\\'s own grave at \"Armenesc\". Cijevschi was posthumously honored at the 20th anniversary of Bessarabian autonomy in 1937. Three years later, the Soviet invasion of Bessarabia clamped down on manifestations of Romanian nationalism. As noted by literary historian Iurie Colesnic, the \"Armenesc\" grave mysteriously escaped being vandalized by the occupiers, possibly because \"it is located to the cemetery\\'s edge.\" In independent, post-Soviet, Moldova, his native village of Zaim became home to a Vasile Cijevschi Public Library.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n(in Romanian) Vitalie Ciobanu, \"Directoratul general de război și marină al Basarabiei (1917–1918)\", in the Moldovan Ministry of Defense Cohorta.

She made her first appearance during the episode broadcast on 3 February 2006. Belle\\'s storylines included finding her birth mother, a drug addiction, her relationship with Aden Jefferies and being diagnosed with cancer. In 2009, it was announced that Tovey had quit the show and the writers decided to kill off the character. Belle made her last appearance on 11 August 2009.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasting\\r\\nTovey joined Home and Away in 2006 when she was 18. The character of Belle was her first television role. On joining the cast, Tovey said she was \"overwhelmed\" and found it \"daunting\". She added \"It was hard not to feel intimidated and nervous about joining the cast, this was really my first television role, so it was a huge step\".\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacter development\\r\\nCharacterisation\\r\\nBelle is described as being a \"cheeky, extroverted young girl\". She was full of insecurity from her \"disciplined and controlling\" upbringing. She craved love and attention from her parents, which they never gave to her. Belle\\'s parents were shocked to discover their daughter was rejecting their conservative lifestyle and hanging out with the wrong crowd. On her character Tovey said \"Belle is fantastic, she\\'s sassy and fun with quite a mouth on her! We have also seen a more vulnerable side to Belle with her romance with Aden this year and next year, we will see Belle go on a bit of a downward spiral which is a good challenge as an actor\".\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroduction\\r\\nTovey explained that her character comes to Summer Bay shortly after learning that she was adopted, as her birth mother lives nearby. A homeless Belle befriends Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) and he agrees to let her stay in his bedroom, though he keeps her presence a secret from his foster parents, and tells her that someone in the house is sick. Belle is soon discovered by Ric\\'s girlfriend Cassie Turner (Sharni Vinson), who Tovey said is \"a bit shocked, as you can imagine!\" Ric\\'s foster mother Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) hears them, and Ric and Belle explain everything to her. While Sally is sympathetic, she tells Ric that Belle cannot stay as her husband Flynn Saunders (Joel McIlroy) has cancer. Tovey told an Inside Soap columnist that Ric just tells Belle to go without explaining why, so she \"doesn\\'t realise why it\\'s such a big deal\" and sneaks back in later on. When she goes to use the bathroom, Belle comes face to face with Flynn and they are both startled, which leads to Belle knocking him down the stairs as she runs away. Tovey said that Belle is so panicked that she does not think to stop and help an unconscious Flynn.\\r\\n\\r\\nPainkiller addiction\\r\\nIn 2009, producers used the character to explore painkiller addiction. The storyline meant Tovey had to spend weeks crying and shouting, but she said that she was determined to do a good job and worked hard on the scenes. Tovey revealed that the addiction storyline made a bigger impression on her than any of Belle\\'s other plots. She also stated, \"It was very challenging at points but I have to say I was quite relieved when it was over because it was quite exhausting at points\". Belle spends weeks lying to cover up her addiction and she becomes \"erratic\". Her painkiller addiction is discovered by her boyfriend, Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance), after he gives her a necklace and she sells it to buy more drugs. Tovey told Carolyn Stewart from TV Week that it was \"a huge deal\" for Belle to give up the necklace to her dealer, but she has nothing else to give him. Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) spots the necklace in a pawnshop and tells Aden, who is heartbroken. Tovey explained, \"He\\'s so in love with her, but by pawning the necklace, she\\'s essentially saying that the drugs mean more to her than he does. She might not think that\\'s true, but the fact is she\\'s put her need for drugs before everything else in her life.\"\\r\\nWhen Aden confronts Belle, she denies taking the pills, but he tears the room apart and finds her stash. He then \"absolutely loses it\" when Belle continues lying to him and storms out. Belle later tells Aden that she will try to get off the drugs, but he know that he cannot be around to witness it, as he went through a similar situation with his alcoholic father. Tovey noted that everything Belle said brought back bad memories for Aden. She also commented that Aden questions everything Belle ever told him and realises that she is no longer the person he fell in love with. A devastated Belle sees that she has pushed him too far and their relationship is over. Tovey said Belle \"feels she has nothing left\" and that \"her whole world seems to be crumbling\" because of her addiction. Tovey thought that fans of the couple should be worried as there seemed to be no way to get through the situation, as Belle\\'s addiction had worn them both \"down to their bare bones.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDeparture\\r\\nIn April 2009, Tovey announced that she had quit Home and Away. On her decision to leave, Tovey said \"I can\\'t stress enough what a hard decision it was and that I nearly changed my mind a few times. I still feel sad about it, but I really just wanted a change\". Tovey\\'s final scenes were filmed in the same month and shown on Australian screens in August. Tovey said she found filming her final scenes \"heartbreaking\", but she said that she was happy with the writers\\' decision to kill off the character.\\r\\n\\r\\nStorylines\\r\\nShortly after finding out she is adopted, Belle arrives in the Bay to find her birth mother. Ric Dalby finds Belle living rough and he brings her food, he later lets Belle hide out in his bedroom. Ric\\'s foster mother, Sally Fletcher finds Belle and insists that she leaves as her husband, Flynn Saunders is terminally ill. Belle returns a few times and one day she accidentally knocks Flynn down the stairs, which weakens his condition. Belle is caught breaking into Irene Roberts\\'s (Lynne McGranger) car and Irene offers her a room at her house. Belle begins spending time with Ric and she kisses him in front of his girlfriend, Cassie Turner. Ric and Cassie split and Belle and Ric begin dating.\\r\\nRic helps Belle in the search for her birth mother and they find Katherine Lansdowne (Geraldine Turner), who turns out to be Belle\\'s grandmother. Kitty tells Belle that her mother is dead, but a few weeks later it is revealed that Amanda Vale (Holly Brisley) is Belle\\'s birth mother. Belle is sad when Ric decides to get back with Cassie. Amanda tries to help Belle win Ric back and relations between mother and daughter thaw. Belle then moves in with Amanda. Belle dates Drew Curtis (Bobby Morley) until Drew suddenly splits up with her for another woman. Amanda tells Belle that she is the other woman and Belle goes back to Irene and starts dating Lucas Holden (Rhys Wakefield). One night, Belle accepts a lift home and is kidnapped by her aunt, Kelli Vale (Alexa Ashton). Peter Baker (Nicholas Bishop) rescues her and relations between Belle and Amanda improve once more. Drew realises that he loves Belle and she still has feelings for him, but she continues to stand by Lucas. Belle mistakenly thinks that Drew slept with Lisa Duffy (Jessica McNamee) and she sleeps with Lucas. Drew and Belle later get back together.

His grandmother taught him to work with clay when he was fifteen, first making cookware and flowerpots. He then moved on to more decorative items, such as figures of birds, women and children, which became imitated by others in the community.  He then began to create lamps in the form of giant tigers and tiger heads, painted in natural colors, which became prized for their artistic quality and have since evolved into sculptures in their own right. Other innovations of his have been to create large vases called “cántaros” with raised designs, and the addition of colored sand and crushed stone to create darker colors and different textures.

In 1746 the family returned to Denmark. After first training with his father, Carl Frederik Stanley became one of the first students to enter the new Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1755. That same year he won his first award and in 1758 he won the Academy's large gold medal for the sculpture Noah's Sacrifice.\\r\\nThe gold medal was accompanied by a six-year travel scholarship and the following year he went abroad to further his education. He first settled in Paris, where he studied under the sculptor Guillaume Coustou. In 1762 he moved to Rome, where he studied and made copies of Classical sculptures, before returning to Denmark in 1766.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nBack in Denmark in 1768, Stanley was commissioned to design the marble funerary monument to Queen Louise in Roskilde Cathedral. He exhibited sketches for the monument at the Academy's first exhibition in 1769 but it was not completed until 1791.\\r\\nDuring the 1770s and 1780s he executed various other monuments, such as that to the shipbuilder Peter Applebye (c. 1774), Christian's Church). He also contributed to the decorations at the Court Theatre and of the Knight's Hall at Christiansborg Palace.\\r\\nIn 1776 he was unanimously accepted as a member of the Royal Art Academy and the following year he received Danish citizenship and was appointed a professor there.\\r\\nFrom 1784 to 1785 he worked on a series of allegorical and historical reliefs for the plinth of the Trade and Navigation Monument at Lyngby. He produced few works after the early 1790s.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nStanley's most significant work remained his funerary monument to Queen Louise. It is located in Frederick V's Chapel and designed in a severe, Neo-classical style.\\r\\nHis admittance piece for the Royal Art Academy was the allegorical Amor patriae of which several examples exist in various materials. Executed in an elegant Neo-classical style, the work shows a partly draped classical figure holding a sword in one hand and a wreath in the other. The statue represents a growing awareness of national identity and history in Denmark which was typical of the time. The previous year, King Christian VII had introduced nationality laws which meant that Government posts and other public offices would in general be reserved for Danish citizens.\\r\\nStanley also produced a number of portrait busts, including a posthumous plaster bust of Johannes Ewald (1784, Danish National Gallery).\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nDanish sculpture\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== External links ==\", 'Renán Almendárez Coello (born November 18, 1953), also known as El Cucuy De La Mañana, is a Honduran-American radio personality.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nHis program is carried on several affiliate stations across the United States.

In fact, his life of constant and lasting migrations across continents and through multiple countries could be used as an example of the limitations of a nationalistic approach to the history of art. He was born in Santiago de Chile in 1901. He spent his childhood and adolescence in Santiago, but as a child he stayed for a whole year at a boarding school in Málaga, in southern Spain. During his youth he spent ten years in Madrid, Spain, where he began to sculpt. At thirty, he returned to Santiago de Chile. There, he continued sculpting and began teaching sculpture at the university. During the Spanish Civil War he went to Barcelona for a few months. He then spent a year in Paris, frequenting some famous sculpture workshops. At forty, he moved to Argentina, where he lived for almost twenty years in the cities of Mendoza and Tucumán, teaching at the university and creating sculptures, embossed metal plates and drawings. In January 1960, he traveled to Easter Island or Rapa Nui, where he spent thirteen months studying the Island\\'s artistic treasures and creating drawings and sculptures of his own. He returned to Argentina in February 1961. In 1963 he died in Mendoza at the age of sixty-one.\\r\\nDefining him as Chilean, or Argentine or European because of the place in which he was born, or learned to sculpt, or worked, would be reductive. Lorenzo Domínguez was a Latin American artist who lived his artistic life under the sign of certain syncretisms. Before his encounter with Easter Island, the artist synthesized the Spanish and French artistic perspectives acquired during his formative years with certain Latin American pre-Columbian artistic features, like privileging stone over other classical sculpting materials such as bronze or wood, or privileging local stones over the more traditional Carrara marble, or using the technique of direct carving. The encounter with the moais and petroglyphs of Easter Island, is not felt by Lorenzo Domínguez as the incorporation of a \"foreign\" element, but as a continuity: in his eyes, Easter Island, with its “stones that look like sculptures and its sculptures that look like simple stones” gives form to Michelangelo\\'s dream of \"sculpting the mountains\", as he says in his Easter Island journals. The encounter with Easter Island and with an aesthetics signed by both monumentality and line, offers Domínguez the opportunity for a new synthesis of European, Latin American pre-Columbian and Rapa Nui artistic elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtistic production: sculptures, embossed metal plates and drawings\\r\\nLorenzo Domínguez completed 252 sculptures that have been photographed and described in the 1998 General Catalog. Although he worked in a great variety of materials, his preferred sculpting media was stone, mainly because he conceived sculpting as a struggle between the artist and the material resisting him. He thought that \"there is no quality in an art that occurs without a struggle\", and that materials like clay and plaster are \"too soft and obedient\", while \"stone resists, but at the same time cooperates... If there is a struggle, stone itself guides the sculptor\\'s hand\" Of Lorenzo Domínguez\\'s sculptures 76 are in stone or marble; 34 in bronze; 5 in wood; 9 in ceramics; 13 in cement; and 115 in plaster. Some of these sculptures were public monuments to Santiago Ramón y Cajal, to Johann Sebastian Bach, to Louis Pasteur, to Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna, to Leandro N. Alem, to José de San Martín and Bernardo O\\'Higgins, to Dr. Miguel Lillo and to Plato. Many of Lorenzo Domínguez\\'s sculptures are portraits, others belong to his \"Planetarium series\" (\"Portrait of the Moon\", \"The Planet Venus\", \"The Planet Saturn\", \"The Milky Way\", \"Berenice\" and \"The Morning Star\"), some are nudes or torsos, some have existential or metaphysical subjects (\"Death\", \"Hope\", \"Time Hieroglyph\"), some have a political subject (\"The Unknown Political Prisoner\", \"Barcelona\", \"Peace\"), some have religious subjects (\"Christ\", \"The Virgin of Hope\", \"Saint Olalla\"), some are of Latin American inspiration (\"Llaima-Llaima\", \"María Coya\", \"La Cuyanita\"), and some are of Easter Island inspiration (\"Father Sebastian Englert from Easter Island\" and \"Young Girl from Easter Island\").\\r\\nLorenzo Domínguez created 34 large embossed metal plates. This is an aesthetic manifestation that is characteristic of his work. It goes beyond what in sculpture is known as a \"relief\", since it actually implies blending the art of drawing with that of sculpting. Domínguez incorporated techniques used by jewelers, but instead of working with small, thin, precious metal sheets, he worked with iron or copper plates that were several millimeters thick, with an area ranging from 50 x 30 cm. to 1 x 1 m. The long embossing process began with a chalk drawing on the back of the metal plate. Then, the metal plate was placed over a warm tar cake. Finally, the plate was pounded strongly and repeatedly, either with a rounded hammer or with a combination of hammer and chisel, until massive volumes emerged towards the front of the plate.\\r\\nLorenzo Domínguez was a draughtsman as well as a sculptor. He started to draw more than ten years after he began to sculpt, and along his artistic life he completed approximately 500 drawings. In the 1998 General Catalog these drawings have been photographed and classified in twenty-three thematic series: Standing nudes, Seated nudes, Reclining nudes, Two nudes, Via Crucis of Don Quixote, Portraits, Religious themes, Maternities, Drawings anticipating Easter Island, Stones, Mythology of Chile, Assorted themes, Moais, Make-Makes, Bird Men, Moai hands, Komaris, Easter Island torsos, Birds, the Flying Bird series, the Marine series, Easter Island stones, and Assorted Easter Island themes.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuotes\\r\\nFor Lorenzo Domínguez, stone is the authentic form of expression of Latin American art: \"In Chile, I realized that sculpture in the Americas should be mainly done in stone, as in pre-Columbian times\".\\r\\n\\r\\nLife and work\\r\\nFrom 1901 to 1920 (Santiago de Chile and Málaga, Spain)\\r\\nLorenzo Domínguez was born in Santiago de Chile, on May 15, 1901. His parents, Sebastián Domínguez Aguilar and Ana Villar Urbano, were from the villages of Colmenar and Casabermeja in the Spanish province of Málaga. As a child Lorenzo Domínguez went to Spain with his parents, and lived in Málaga for a year studying at the Jesuit boarding school of San Estanislao de Kostka, in Miraflores del Palo, Málaga.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1920 to 1931 (Madrid, Spain)\\r\\nLife and cultural context\\r\\nIn 1920 Lorenzo Domínguez returned to Spain, where he would stay for the next eleven years. He studied medicine in Madrid for five years. During Primo de Rivera\\'s dictatorship, he frequented two leftist cultural circles (\"tertulias\"): a scientific and medical group linked to Santiago Ramón y Cajal, winner of the 1906 Nobel Prize for Medicine, and a group of writers and artists associated with the great modernist writer, Ramón del Valle Inclán. Cajal\\'s group included medical professionals like García del Real, professor of pathology; Juan Negrín, a physiologist and socialist politician who would later become the last President of the Government (Prime Minister) of the Second Spanish Republic; and Pío del Río-Hortega, a famous neuro-histologist who left Spain after the Civil War, dying in Buenos Aires in 1945. Valle Inclán\\'s group included writers and artists like Enrique Díez Canedo, poet and literary critic; Ricardo Baroja, painter; José Gutiérrez Solana, painter and writer; occasionally the poet Antonio Machado; Juan de Echeverría, painter; Ignacio Sánchez Mejías, the bullfighter and writer; Juan de la Encina, art critic; and Manuel Azaña, a writer and politician who would later become the last President of the Second Spanish Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nIn 1926, while he was still studying medicine, Lorenzo Domínguez realized that his true vocation was sculpting. From 1926 to 1931 he worked at the art workshops of Juan Cristóbal and Emiliano Barral. Important works from this period include two heads in marble, \"Cajal\" and \"Julia\"; a stone portrait of Martín Luis Guzmán, the Mexican writer; and a bronze head called \"Young Woman with Short Hair\". Also, Domínguez carved a stone monument dedicated to Santiago Ramón y Cajal that is placed at the College of Doctors, or \"Ilustre Colegio Oficial de Médicos de Madrid\" (Santa Isabel, Nº 51, Madrid). A full size cement copy has been placed at the nearby \"Instituto de las Administraciones Públicas\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1931 to 1938 (Santiago de Chile, first period)\\r\\nLife and cultural context\\r\\nIn 1931, Lorenzo Domínguez returned to Santiago de Chile and began teaching sculpture at the Escuela de Bellas Artes de Santiago. He befriended other plastic artists like the painters Hernán Gazmuri, Abelardo Bustamante, Inés Puyó and María Tupper, as well as painters from the Montparnasse Group (Camilo Mori, Pablo Burchard, Augusto Eguiluz and Anita Cortés); sculptors like Samuel Román Rojas, Totila Albert and Laura Rodig; poets like Pablo Neruda, winner of the 1971 Nobel Prize for Literature, Vicente Huidobro, the vanguardist author responsible for \"creacionismo\", and Nicanor Parra; writers like the novelists Marta Brunet, Augusto d\\'Halmar, Manuel Rojas and Mariano Latorre; musicians like Claudio Arrau, Acario Cotapos, Víctor Tevah and Rosita Renard; and scientists like professor Alejandro Lipschutz. His students included Lily Garáfulic, Marta Colvin, María Bellet and María Fuentealba.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nBetween 1931 and 1938 Lorenzo Domínguez completed three public monuments. The first, a bronze sculpture, was dedicated \"To Jaime Pinto Riesco\", a young medicine student killed by the police on July 24, 1931, during a demonstration against Carlos Ibáñez\\'s dictatorship (1927–1931); the second one, a large stone head \"To Johann Sebastian Bach\", is placed at the Parque Forestal, in Santiago; the third one is a stone monument placed at the Department of Dentistry at the Universidad de Chile, dedicated \"To Dr. Germán Valenzuela Basterrica\", the founder of Chile\\'s Dental School. Other sculptures from this period are \"Nieves\", a portrait of Nieves Yáncovic; \"Nana\" and \"Saint Olalla\" in Carrara marble; a stone portrait of the writer \"Augusto d\\'Halmar\"; a beautiful bronze portrait of \"Elisa Bindhoff\", André Breton\\'s wife; a bronze portrait of \"The Painter Pablo Burchard\" and a bronze \"Portrait of the Painter Hernán Gazmuri\", that is now at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de Santiago. There are other bronzes from this period: \"Archbishop Errázuriz\", \"Elena Bezanilla\", \"Eliana\", \"Olga\", \"Graciela\", \"Magdalena\" and a mask of \"Professor Lipschutz\". \"Lilión\", a female head in green marble from Florence, is one of his masterpieces. A bronze of \"Lilión\", is at the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de Santiago.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1938 to 1939 (Spain, France and England)\\r\\nIn 1938 Lorenzo Domínguez returned to Europe. He stayed a few months in Barcelona, assisting Republican groups that saved artistic treasures endangered by the civil war. Afterwards, he traveled to London and Paris, where he was impressed by Picasso\\'s exhibition at Paul Rosenberg\\'s gallery. Domínguez stayed in Paris for almost a year frequenting the art workshops of Bourdelle, Brâncuși and Maillol. He considered Bourdelle, who had died in 1929, a genius. He unconditionally admired Maillol as a sculptor, but not as much as a drawer. He also admired Brâncuși, although at times he thought the surfaces of some of Brâncuși\\'s sculptures were far too shiny and far too polished.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1939 to 1941 (Santiago de Chile, second period)\\r\\nIn 1939 Lorenzo Domínguez returned to Santiago de Chile and continued teaching sculpture at the Escuela de Bellas Artes. From June to September, 1939, three of his sculptures were exhibited at the New York Riverside Museum, in the Latin American Exhibition of Fine and Applied Art (\"Lilión\", \"Saint Olalla\" and \"Cajal\"). Between 1939 and 1941 Lorenzo Domínguez completed the monument \"To Dr. Luis Calvo Mackenna\", a Chilean pediatrician. This maternity scene in black basalt is located in the Parque Balmaceda of Santiago. He also completed an important black basalt sculpture, \"Portrait of the Moon\", the first of his \"Planetarium series\"; and a stone portrait of the \"Painter Augusto Eguiluz\". Domínguez\\'s masterpiece from this period is \"Victor Delhez\", a portrait of the Belgian engraver, carved in Carrara marble.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1941 to 1949 (Mendoza, Argentina, first period)\\r\\nLife and cultural context\\r\\nIn 1941 Lorenzo Domínguez moved to Mendoza, Argentina, to teach sculpture at the recently founded Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. In Mendoza, he married Clara Digiovanni, a professor of English at the same university. They had three children: Federica, Lorenzo and Fernán.\\r\\nMendoza, and especially the new university, had a vibrant cultural atmosphere. During his time in Mendoza (1941–1949; 1956–1959; 1961–1963), Lorenzo Domínguez re-encountered Victor Delhez, whom he had met in Santiago de Chile, and befriended other artists: painters like Francisco Bernareggi, Ramón Gómez Cornet, Roberto Azzoni, Rosalía Flichman, Roberto Cascarini, Fidel de Lucia, José Manuel Gil, Enrique Sobisch and Rosa Arturo; the draughtsmen Fivaller Subirats and Mario Marziali; the humorist and cartoonist Joaquín Lavado or \"Quino\"; engravers like Sergio Hocevar (or Sergio Sergi) and Heriberto Hualpa; poets and writers, like Reinaldo Bianchini, Alberto Cirigliano, Alberto Dáneo, Daniel Devoto, Jorge Enrique Ramponi, Guillermo Kaúl, Américo Calí, Ricardo Tudela, Antonio Di Benedetto, Julio Cortázar, Abelardo Vázquez, Juan Villaverde, Iverna Codina, Angélica Mendoza, Fernando Lorenzo, Víctor Hugo Cúneo, Armando Tejada Gómez, Rodolfo Braceli and Hugo Acevedo; the historian Claudio Sánchez Albornoz; the writer and philosophy professor Diego F. Pró, who would later become his biographer; Ernesto and Joan Coromines, who were respectively mathematician and philologist; Edmundo Correas, first rector of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo; professors of literature like Adolfo Ruiz Díaz, Alfredo Roggiano, Emilia Puceiro and Delia Villalobos; other professors like Matilde Zuloaga, Enrique Zuleta Álvarez, Lorenzo Mascialino and Manlio Lugaresi; the mathematician Manuel Balanzat; the medical doctors Fernando Mas Robles, Francisco Correas, Francisco Amengual, Mario Burgos and Rodolfo Muratorio Posse; several musicians, like the pianist Antonio De Raco, the composer Isidro Maiztegui, the composer and singer of folk songs Jaime Dávalos, the organist and composer Julio Perceval, Juan Salomone, Amicarelli, Julio Malaval, the pianist Estela López Lubary and the singers Mary Lan and Mercedes Sosa; the actress and theater director Galina Tolmacheva and the actress Niní Gambier; the folklorist and narrator Juan Draghi Lucero; the journalist Miguel Gómez Echea; the editor Gildo D\\'Accurzio; the photographer Antonio D\\'Elia; the lawyer Juan Carlos Silva; and the architects Daniel Ramos Correas, Samuel Sánchez de Bustamante, and Arturo and Manolo Civit.\\r\\nAmong his students, four young artists worked with him for an extended period: Beatriz Capra, Mariano Pagés, José Carrieri and Carlos de la Mota. Other students included: Luis Quesada, Carlos Alonso, Orlando Pardo, Leonor Rigau, Miguel Ángel Sugo, Marcelo Santángelo, Irene Pepa, Elio Mirrado, Alberto Moscatelli and José Bermúdez.\\r\\nPeriodically, Lorenzo Domínguez traveled to Buenos Aires. There, his friends were sculptors like Líbero Badii, Antonio Sibellino, Alfredo Bigatti, José Fioravanti, Horacio Juárez, Noemí Gerstein and Lea Lublin; painters like Emilio Pettoruti, Héctor Basaldúa, Benito Quinquela Martín, Lucio Fontana, Raquel Forner, Luis Seoane, Alfredo Guido, Ernesto Farina and Mariette Lydis; ceramists like Fernando Arranz and Tove Johansen; art critics like Jorge Romero Brest, Córdova Iturburu, Julio Payró, Roger Plá, José Luis Pagano, Lorenzo Varela, Miguel de los Santos and Romualdo Brughetti; photographers like Horacio Coppola, Grete Stern and Anatole Saderman; poets and writers like the Spanish poet Rafael Alberti and his wife, the novelist María Teresa León, the Guatemalan novelist Miguel Ángel Asturias, Nobel Prize in literature in 1967, the vanguardist authors Oliverio Girondo and Eduardo González Lanuza, and other writers and poets like Manuel Mujica Láinez, Mario Binetti and Victoria Ocampo; actors and theater people like Margarita Xirgu, Delia Garcés, Pedro López Lagar or the scenographer Gori Muñoz; the editor Gonzalo Losada; and art collectors like Víctor Bossart and Federico Vogelius.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nDuring his first period in Mendoza, from 1941 to 1949, Lorenzo Domínguez created some of his main sculptural works. He completed seven public monuments. Two of them are dedicated \"To Pasteur\": the first one at the Institute of Bacteriology in Santiago de Chile, and the other one at the Lagomaggiore Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Mendoza. Two monuments were dedicated \"To Leandro N. Alem\", a famous Argentine politician of democratic and anti-authoritarian ideas that in 1891 founded what is considered Argentina\\'s oldest political party, the Radical Civic Union. Both monuments are in Mendoza: one at a park (Parque del Este), the other one at a school (Leandro N. Alem). Lorenzo Domínguez also completed a stone monument dedicated to \"To Dr. Anacleto Gil\", a 19th. century governor of the Argentine province of San Juan. It is located in Parque de Mayo, a park in the city of San Juan. The most important monument completed during this period is \"To San Martín and O\\'Higgins\", dedicated to José de San Martín and Bernardo O\\'Higgins, two crucial historical figures who led Argentina and Chile in their wars of independence from colonial Spain. The monument, placed at the central \"Chile\" square in Mendoza, is a tribute to the friendship between both countries. It portrays two stone figures 3.50 m. high, standing over a massive stone base and grasping a common sword. Another monument from this period is the \"Christ of the Resurrection\". Located at the campus of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, this bronze figure reaches 2.40 m. both in arm span and in height and is a posthumous cast from the original 1947 plaster.\\r\\nBetween 1941 and 1949 the artist added five stone carvings to the \"Planetarium series\" that he had started in Santiago with \"Portrait of the Moon\": \"The Planet Venus\", \"The Planet Saturn\", \"The Milky Way\", \"Berenice\" and \"The Morning Star\". He also carved \"Cuyanita\", the head of a young girl from the Argentine region of Cuyo, in Carrara marble; \"Little Red Nude\", in red stone; and \"Miguel Servet\", also in red stone, a study for a monument to the Spanish philosopher and scientist who, after discovering and describing the circulation of blood in the 16th. century, was condemned by both Catholics and Protestants and burnt alive at the stake as a heretic. During his first period in Mendoza, Lorenzo Domínguez completed several new portraits in stone: two portraits of his wife, \"Clara\" and \"Clara Federica\"; \"Francisco Bernareggi\"; \"Beatriz Capra\"; \"Ramón Gómez Cornet\", placed at the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes in Santiago del Estero, Argentina; \"Sergio Sergi\", in black granite and one of the artist\\'s masterpieces; \"Marjorie\", in Carrara marble; \"Federica\", a first portrait of his daughter; \"La Pilo\", Ramón Gómez Cornet\\'s daughter; \"Zezette Dáneo\", placed at the Art Department of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo; \"Paco Correas\", Dr. Francisco Correas\\' son; \"The Poet Ramponi\"; \"Hipólito Digiovanni\", his father in-law; and \"Francisco Amengual\" and his wife \"Dorita Zabalza de Amengual\". \"Llaima-Llaima\", a female bust in golden stone, excels among the works completed between 1941 and 1949 and is one of his masterpieces. There are also two large half figures: \"María Ticac\" in yellow stone and \"Ana Villar de Domínguez\", a portrait of his mother.\\r\\nBesides these works in stone, Lorenzo Domínguez completed sculptures in other materials. He made several portraits in plaster: \"Dr. Fernando Mas Robles\", the Spanish physician who was his lifetime friend; \"Estelita Civit\", wife of Manolo Civit, an architect from Mendoza; \"Argentina Gómez Cornet\", the great painter\\'s wife; and \"Irma\", a portrait of Irma Aragonés, one of his wife Clara\\'s friends. Also in plaster are \"Sarmiento\", and \"Young Infanta from Mendoza\", a project for a monument to San Martín\\'s daughter that represents a mother-daughter group. An important work in plaster is \"The Married Woman\", a large-sized female figure that the artist made in Mendoza and then took with him when he moved to Tucumán in 1949. During his first period in Mendoza, Lorenzo Domínguez completed a \"Christ\" in colored, gold-plated wood. He made several works in ceramics, including \"Barcelona\" (1941), a 64 cm. sculpture that portrays a mother holding her child and looking upwards towards a menacing sky that we can imagine full of airplanes and bombs. This sculpture, as well as some drawings with the same theme that the author made during his second period in Mendoza, is a powerful denunciation of Nazi air raids during the Spanish Civil War and a symbol of the sufferings inflicted by war.\\r\\nBetween 1941 and 1949 the artist began two series of drawings: the \"Portraits Series\", started with \"Clara Federica\", a portrait of his wife, and the \"Religious Themes Series\". Domínguez was not a practicing Catholic, but he had a sense of the sacred, and a profound knowledge of the Old and New Testaments and of later Christian history. Between 1941 and 1949 the artist completed \"The Prophet Jonas\", \"The Virgin of Hope\", \"Judith\" and \"Saint Joan\". He also made drawings on assorted themes like \"Pegasus\", \"Aristotle\" and three drawings of strong erotic connotations entitled \"Metropolitan Venus\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1949 to 1956 (Tucumán, Argentina)\\r\\nLife and cultural context\\r\\nIn 1949 Lorenzo Domínguez moved from Mendoza to Tucumán to work as a professor of sculpture at the Universidad Nacional de Tucumán.\\r\\nAt the time, the city of Tucumán had become an artistic center, hosting painters like Lino Enea Spilimbergo, Ramón Gómez Cornet, Luis Lobo de la Vega, Timoteo Navarro, José Nieto Palacios, Francisco Ramoneda and Medardo Pantoja; engravers like Pompeyo Audivert and Víctor Rebuffo; draughtsmen like Lajos Szalay and Eugenio Hirsch; and a group of jewelers and metal workers headed by Pedro Zurro de la Fuente. Horacio Descole was the rector of the University, and Guido Parpagnoli the dean of the Instituto Superior de Artes. Lorenzo Domínguez\\'s circle of colleagues and friends included the writers Enrique Anderson Imbert and Pablo Rojas Paz; the architects Eduardo Sacriste, Hilario Zalba, Jorge Vivanco, Horacio Caminos, Eithel Federico Traine, Federico Lerena and Enrico Tedeschi; the biology and medicine researchers Cecilio Romagna, Giuseppe Cei and Juan Carlos Fasciolo; the psychiatrist Juan Dalma; the priest Petit de Murat; the orchestra director Carlos Félix Cillario and, whenever he had a concert, the harpist Nicanor Zabaleta.\\r\\nOccasionally, during his Tucumán period, Domínguez traveled to Resistencia, Chaco, where he met Aldo and Efraín Boglietti and Hilda Torres Varela who, along with other intellectuals, had organized a cultural center and a residence for artists, the \"Fogón de los Arrieros\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nIn Tucumán the artist made three monuments for the Miguel Lillo Biology Institute, at the Universidad Nacional de Tucumán. Among them, \"To Dr. Miguel Lillo\", or \"Flora\" and \"Fauna\", is the most important with its two standing female nudes in stone, almost three meters high. One of the figures carries flower garlands on her head and hands, while the other holds a puma cub in her arms. The second monument, also in stone, is dedicated to \"Professor Schreiter\", a German ethnographer and naturalist that worked with Dr. Miguel Lillo. The third monument is an owl of wisdom, a large figure in cement that is part of the colorful \"Fountain of Science\".\\r\\nFrom 1949 to 1956, Domínguez created some important sculptures in stone: \"Black Boxer\" in blue stone; \"Leonor\", a portrait of the artist Leonor Rigau in black granite; \"La Señorita\"; \"María Coya\"; \"María Rosa\"; \"Federica\", a second portrait of his daughter; and \"Time Hieroglyph\", a large relief in red stone. Four works excel among the stone and marble sculptures of this period: \"Portrait of my wife\", a third portrait of his wife Clara, characterized for its slightly asymmetrical features that suggest the \"soft\" and \"hard\" sides of her personality; \"Guido Parpagnoli\", a monumental head in red stone; \"Death\", in black basalt; and especially \"The Unknown Political Prisoner\", a tragic figure carved in red stone, portraying a skull with two hands that cover its eye sockets.\\r\\nBesides these works in stone, Lorenzo Domínguez completed sculptures in other materials: a bronze portrait of \"The Painter Lino Enea Spilimbergo\"; two works in ceramics, \"The Virgin of Hope\", a seated female figure, and \"The Little Mother\", a playful maternity that depicts a little girl hugging her doll; several portraits in plaster, \"Ana Villar de Domínguez\", a new portrait of his mother; \"Pompeyo Audivert\", the engraver; \"Argentina Gómez Cornet\", the painter\\'s wife; and \"Horacio Descole\", the rector of the Universidad Nacional de Tucumán. \"The Argentine Antarctic\" is a symbolic work in plaster that portrays a powerful female figure wearing boots and heavy leather clothes, with a sea lion by her side. \"Manuel de Falla\" is a musical angel also in plaster, a project for a monument to the musician that is located at the Museo Manuel de Falla, in Alta Gracia, Córdoba, Argentina. \"Peace Dove\", a small work in plaster, portrays a fallen dove that symbolizes the failure of the peace ideal.\\r\\nIn Tucumán, Lorenzo Domínguez developed and mastered his technique for embossing large iron or copper plates. On this media, the prevalent themes are: figures from the Old and New Testaments, Latin American figures of pre-Columbian style, figures from classical European myths, and above all the subject of Don Quixote. Some important embossed metal plates from this period are: \"Adam and Eve\", \"The Prophet Jonas\", \"Judith and Holofernes\", \"Christ\", \"Saint John the Baptist\", \"Visitation\", \"Fight between Pachamama and War\", \"The Abduction of Europa\", \"Don Miguel de Unamuno\" and two very large plates, \"Portrait of the Sun\" and \"Our Lord Don Quixote\". There are also eight iron plates that belong to the series of Don Quixote\\'s \"falls\": \"Strangling of the Hand\", \"Crucifixion in Madness\", \"Crucifixion in Health\", \"Encounter with Insanity\", \"The Invisible Wall\", \"Censorship\", \"The Creative Hand\" and \"The Spoliation\".\\r\\nFrom 1949 to 1956, Lorenzo Domínguez worked on some of his most important drawings. He did a brief series of four drawings about the subject of maternity. He continued with the \"Religious Themes Series\" (\"Crucifixion\", \"Christ\", and \"The Four Horsemen of Apocalypse\") and with the series of the \"Portraits\", both of which he had started in Mendoza. Within this last series he did several family portraits: \"Clara\", \"Ana Villar\", two portraits of his daughter Federica, two portraits of his son Fernán, a portrait entitled \"Lorenzo\" and another one entitled \"Little Boy\". There is also a portrait of his friend, the painter \"Spilimbergo\"; and a portrait of an anonymous young woman entitled \"Young Girl from Tucumán\". An enigmatic drawing of this period is \"Self Esteem\".\\r\\nIn Tucumán, the artist began two new series of drawings: the \"Mythology of Chile\" with two drawings entitled \"Valparaíso\", and the \"Series of the Stones\" with a drawing called \"Reclining Woman\".\\r\\nHe also began three of his four series of nudes: \"Standing Nudes\", \"Seated Nudes\" and \"Reclining Nudes\". Domínguez drew only female nudes, and they vary from the realistic to the stylized. His nudes amount for a large percent of the total of the artist\\'s drawings (200/500).\\r\\nBetween 1954 and 1955 Lorenzo Domínguez started and completed the series of drawings he called \"Via Crucis of Don Quixote\". These drawings on the subject of Don Quixote\\'s falls are an aesthetic transposition of twenty four physical and symbolic falls suffered by Miguel de Cervantes\\' literary hero. The series consists of thirty-two drawings, with different versions and studies for some of the falls. Lorenzo Domínguez was always attracted by this Spanish novel, both as reading matter and subject of meditation, and as an aesthetic paradigm. In the figure of the knight-errant, the artist finds everlasting symbols. His twenty-four physical falls (perhaps twenty-four spiritual triumphs) are varied in nature. Some are caused by cruelty or vulgarity: in \"Encounter with Servility\" Don Quixote finds some merchants and is beaten by a mule keeper; in \"Encounter with Brutality\" he is beaten by a goat shepherd; \"Sadism\" refers to a passage in the novel when the dukes, as a cruel joke, free a bag full of angry cats, and the animals attack and injure Don Quixote; in \"Strangling of the Hand\" Maritornes mocks him and lets him hang from a window for an entire night; and in \"The Abuse of Genius\", Don Quixote is run over by a herd of swine. There are falls due to ingratitude, like \"The Spoliation\", where Don Quixote, after freeing the galley prisoners, is robbed by them; or \"Sancho\\'s Betrayal\", where he is beaten by Sancho Panza; or \"Encounter with Friendship\", where Don Quixote is knocked down by his friend Bachelor Sansón Carrasco in disguise as the Knight of the White Moon. In \"Encounter with Lust\", a muleteer in love with Maritornes hits Don Quixote, causing him to fall. Sometimes it is fantasy itself that falls through, pulling Don Quixote along; and thus, there is a \"First Shipwreck of Fantasy\", a depiction of the hero\\'s catastrophic trip in the enchanted ship; and a \"Second Shipwreck of Fantasy\", about another catastrophic trip on a flying horse. There are falls caused by madness: by poetic madness in \"Crucifixion in Madness\", where Don Quixote appears on the cross of the allegorical windmill; and by the pathological madness of Cardenio in \"Encounter with Insanity\". For today\\'s observer this Via Crucis offers some interesting and polemic falls, like \"Censorship\", where Don Quixote is forced by some of his most prominent neighbors -the priest and the barber- to return to his village, muzzled and in a cage; or like \"Encounter with Power\", where Don Quixote falls from his horse, overwhelmed at the sight of the powerful aristocratic figures of the Duke and his wife. Falls of definite political nature are \"The Civil War\", and \"Horror of the Future\". In the first drawing, Spain fights against Spain, and Don Quixote, a symbol of Spain, is attacked and run over by a herd of bulls, another symbol of Spain. In the second drawing, there is a deliberate anachronism: Don Quixote falls at the doors of Barcelona, as if hit by a premonition of the Spanish Civil War. In the drawing, Lorenzo Domínguez\\'s sculpture \"Barcelona\" appears as homage to the victims of bombings. In the last fall, \"Crucifixion in Health\", the religious dimension of Don Quixote, already suggested in \"Crucifixion in Madness\", becomes clearer. In this final fall, the Spanish knight stops being Don Quixote. In this drawing, Cervantes\\' character appears at the center, and to his right and left appear the housekeeper and the niece, mimicking the female figures of the Christian crucifixion. Upon breaking the spear, the knight\\'s arms become the arms of a cross. Don Quixote dies on that cross, and only Alonso Quijano is left behind. Lorenzo Domínguez intended to use the drawings of the \"Via Crucis of Don Quixote\" to illustrate a special edition of Cervantes\\' novel, a project that he never abandoned, not even during his stay in Easter Island. Between 1949 and 1956, some of the drawings about Don Quixote\\'s falls developed into large embossed metal plates.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1956 to 1959 (Mendoza, Argentina, second period)\\r\\nLife and cultural context\\r\\nIn 1956 Lorenzo Domínguez left Tucumán and returned to the Escuela Superior de Artes Plásticas of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo in Mendoza. After the artist\\'s arrival in 1956 some of his old disciples returned to his workshop, and new ones arrived: Carmen Gracia, Mónica Wasmuth, Claudia Zanettini, Chipo Céspedes, Juan Antonio García, Teresa Larrañaga Domínguez, Matías Vial, and Eliana Molinelli.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nLorenzo Domínguez completed two important sculptures between 1956 and 1959: a monument dedicated to \"Plato\", placed at the Department of Philosophy and Letters of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, and a \"Torso\" in black granite.\\r\\nHe also completed several embossed metal plates: \"Saint Barbara\", \"The Mountains\", \"The Pregnant Woman\" and \"The Visit\", a large iron plate on the theme of the visitation of the Virgin Mary to Saint Elizabeth symbolizing hospitality.\\r\\nDuring this period the artist concentrated on his drawings. He continued with his first three series of nudes, the \"Standing\", \"Seated\" and \"Reclining Nudes\", and he started the new \"Two Nudes Series\". He made several portraits, including \"Gloria\", \"Checkered Woman\", an anonymous \"Portrait\", and another \"Portrait\" of a woman with half closed eyes. The artist continued with the religious themes: \"Santa Barbara\", \"Christ and Saint John\", \"Veronica\", \"Virgin\", \"The Unrepentant Thief\" \"Sanctity\", \"The Visit\", and one of his masterpieces, \"Jude\\'s Kiss\". The artist completed his series on the \"Mythology of Chile\", with some drawings inspired by pre-Columbian figures and by the wound left by the Spanish conquest, like his three drawings about the Araucanian woman (\"Araucanian Venus\") and his drawings about the torture and martyrdom of the native chief (\"cacique\") Caupolicán. There are also eight drawings about the Chilean poet, \\r\\nGabriela Mistral, Nobel Prize in literature in 1945. In this subseries of drawings, the poet\\'s figure is represented with different levels of abstraction and detail, thus helping us to understand some of the artist\\'s aesthetic processes. Domínguez completed another series that, at a later time, was called \"Drawings Anticipating Easter Island\", and he finished the series that he called \"Stones\". This series consists of fifteen drawings depicting monumental or monster-like figures that seem spurting from the rock: the second drawing in the series, \"Stone\", represents the head of an animal with prominent fangs; another one, \"Johann Sebastian Bach\", evokes the monument in stone that the artist had completed in Chile; three drawings called \"The Milky Way\", evoke the artist\\'s sculpture from the \"planetarium series\"; and four drawings represent the figures of Christ and the devil as blocks of stone. Among the \"Assorted Themes Series\", there are some magnificent subseries on the bombing of \"Barcelona\" during the Spanish Civil War; the \"Childbirth\" theme; and \"The Death of the Rabbit\", that depicts the killing of rabbits by peasants. Other drawings of this last series are: \"Condors\", \"Angel\", \"Kiss of Black and White\", \"Plato\", and the extraordinary \"Smiling Woman\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom January 1960 to February 1961 (Easter Island, Chile)\\r\\nLife and cultural context\\r\\nFor thirteen months from January 1960 until February 1961, thanks to a grant from Fondo Nacional de las Artes (Secretaría de Cultura, Argentine Government), Lorenzo Domínguez fulfilled his lifetime dream of living and working among the moais and petroglyphs of Easter Island.\\r\\nThis Chilean Island, also called Rapa Nui, is one of the most isolated places on earth, since it is in the Southeastern Pacific Ocean, 2000 miles from continental Chile and Tahiti which are the nearest population centers. In 1960 travel to the Island was very difficult as airtravel had not yet been established between Easter Island and continental Chile. The only regular communication was a Chilean Navy transport ship which visited the Island in January, and only remained there for ten or fifteen days, so travelers who did not return with the ship had to stay in the Island for the whole year.\\r\\nOn January 11, 1960, Lorenzo Domínguez left the Chilean port of Valparaíso towards Easter Island, arriving on January 18, and staying until February 1, 1961. During these thirteen months he created sculptures and drawings, wrote a personal and artistic journal, and photographed the sculptures and petroglyphs of the Island.\\r\\nHis returning trip would be an adventure in itself, since he took an unexpected opportunity to fly back to Chile. With his return ship already anchored at the Island and ready to go back to the continent, a plane arrived. The pilot was Roberto Parragué, a Chilean Capitán de Bandada, who was performing his third adventurous flight between Valparaíso and Easter Island in an old Flying boat, the Manutara II. Parragué let Lorenzo Domínguez book a seat in his plane, and Domínguez thus became one of the first two commercial passengers to fly from Easter Island to Chile.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nDuring the year he lived in Easter Island, Lorenzo Domínguez made one large sculpture, a portrait of Father Sebastian Englert, the priest, linguist and ethnographer who lived on Easter Island from 1935 until his death in 1969. Lorenzo Domínguez completed Englert\\'s head in plaster in the Island, and carved it in wood in Mendoza after his return. He also carved some small reliefs on Easter Island stones.\\r\\nBetween January 1960 and February 1961, Lorenzo Domínguez completed 128 large drawings inspired by the moais and petroglyphs of the Island, as well as sketches that he would afterwards develop into finished drawings or into large embossed metal plates. These works are all described and photographed in the 1998 General Catalog. There are nine series of drawings from the Island: the \"Series of the Moais\" (29 drawings inspired by the Moai (gigantic stone sculptures of the Island)); the \"Series of the Make-Makes\" (32 drawings inspired by Petroglyphs of Make Make a god with big eyes who is frequently represented in Rapa Nui petroglyphs); the \"Series of the Bird-Men\" (17 drawings about some mythological beings, half man and half bird that symbolize the Tangata Manu - victor hero of a competition for power and for a legendary egg); the \"Series of the Moai Hands\" (10 drawings); the \"Series of the Komaris\" (7 drawings about the komari or vulva another frequent topic for Rapa Nui petroglyphs); the \"Series of the Birds\" (5 drawings that have the central motif of two birds facing each other with their beaks touching, thus suggesting the second title for the drawings: \"The Kiss\"); the \"Series of the Flying Bird\" (5 drawings inspired in a particular stone relief from Anakena that Lorenzo Domínguez considered the supreme masterpiece among the Island\\'s petroglyphs: a bird, or bird-man, whose stylization was for Domínguez \"a stroke of genius\"); the \"Marine Series\" (5 drawings on a particular type of petroglyphs, engraved on the ground and depicting some sea creatures); and the \"Series of the Easter Island Stones\" (5 drawings of stones of remarkable shapes, including some that suggest a skull or the idea of death). He also made 12 drawings from two other series that he would complete later: the first three drawings of the \"Series of the Easter Island Torsos\", a series with a total of six female torsos; and the first nine drawings of the \"Series of Assorted Easter Island Themes\", a series of twelve drawings of miscellaneous subjects: a ship followed by a bird that could represent the devil; a face covered by a hand and drawn with reddish soil from the Island; groups of apes or ape-men, with references to the idea of sexual potency; and the subject of flowers and fecundation.\\r\\nFrom this period, there is a drawing representing “Christ” that, at least at surface level, sets itself apart from the thematic universe of Easter Island. In the 1998 General Catalog it has been included as part of the \"Religious Themes Series\" (REL30).\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1961 to 1963 (Mendoza, Argentina, third period)\\r\\nLife\\r\\nOn February 2, 1961, Lorenzo Domínguez landed at Santiago de Chile. A few days afterwards he returned to Mendoza, to his wife, his two sons and daughter and his mother, as well as to his workshop in Montevideo Street, the old building where he taught his classes to the art students of the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. He lived only two more years, and on March 21, 1963, he died in the arms of his wife, after suffering a heart attack.\\r\\nThis last period of his life, saddened only by the death of his mother Ana, brought serene and happy years with his family, friends and students. It was also a fruitful period from an artistic point of view. He had much public recognition. There were interviews, conferences and exhibitions, particularly a large one organized in Buenos Aires at the National Museum of Fine Arts, or Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, that included drawings, embossed metal plates and enlargements of some of the photographs he had taken in Easter Island. He also wrote several chapters of his book Las esculturas de la Isla de Pascua.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nBetween 1961 and 1963 Lorenzo Domínguez completed a large sculpture in red stone, \"Peace\", representing an angel breaking a sword; and he carved two wood heads of Easter Island inspiration: \"Young Girl from Easter Island\" and \"Father Sebastian Englert\".\\r\\nHe completed eight large embossed iron and copper plates on Easter Island subjects, all of which can be considered masterpieces: \"Ship Chased by an Aku-Aku\", or demon; \"Hieroglyph from Hanga-Papara\", on the subject of fecundation; \"Komaris\", or vulvas; \"Make-Make of the Storm\"; the stylized \"Flying Bird\"; a copper plate entitled \"The Birds, or The Kiss\"; \"The Shipwrecked\", that depicts anthropomorphic oars representing shipwreck and death; and \"Easter Island Torso\", a copper plate depicting a powerful female torso. In 1961 the artist finished an embossed copper plate, \"Breakfast is Ready\", on the subject of painful servitude: mother and child are carrying a tray, lacerated by the nails and crown of thorns typical of Christian crucifixion.\\r\\nDuring this period Lorenzo Domínguez performed drawings that can also be considered masterpieces and show the influence of the aesthetic experience he had just lived in Easter Island. He completed three drawings on the \"Shipwreck\" subseries (Series of Assorted Easter Island Themes) and three \"Easter Island Torsos\"; as well as two drawings with the subject of \"Christ\" that are related to the \"Christ\" drawn during his stay in Easter Island. He made a drawing about \"Valle Inclán\", the Spanish writer that he had met in his youth; and three about \"Don Quixote\", in two of which Don Quixote is identified with Christ, creating an aesthetic synthesis of two figures that are a symbolic constant along Domínguez\\'s artistic biography. In these two drawings, Don Quixote appears with a crown of thorns or a halo, and with his hand raised in the act of blessing. Both drawings are called \"I Know Who I Am\", in reference to some intriguing words pronounced by Don Quixote in chapter V of the first part of Cervantes\\' novel. Other drawings of this period with religious connotations are: \"Saint Gemma\", \"Saint with Cross\", and two representations of the \"Virgin of Luján\", conceived as the starting point for an embossed iron or a tombstone to be placed at the gravesite of the artist\\'s mother. There is also an enigmatic drawing that has vague hagiographic echoes, entitled \"The Blind Woman from Palmira\", Palmira being a small city near Mendoza. During this period from February 1961 to the moment of his death, Domínguez worked on three series of nudes: \"Seated Nudes\", \"Reclining Nudes\" and \"Two Nudes\". He worked in a subseries of portraits entitled \"Young Girl from Mendoza\" and in a drawing entitled \"Woman from Mendoza\". A curious drawing of this period is \"The Madly in Love Melon Vendor\", a love message addressed to his wife Clara.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritings: his book on Easter Island and his Easter Island journals\\r\\n1. Lorenzo Domínguez left a book on Easter Island\\'s sculptures: Domínguez, Lorenzo. Las esculturas de la Isla de Pascua, Prólogo y complementación de la obra por Clara D. de Domíguez, Estudio preliminar, nómina de sus obras y bibliografía por Diego F. Pró, Buenos Aires: Fondo Nacional de las Artes, 1968. \\r\\nLorenzo Domínguez\\'s death interrupted the preparation and edition of this book. It was completed afterwards by his wife Clara Digiovanni de Domínguez. His biographer, Diego F. Pró wrote the preliminary study as well as the extensive bibliography that includes articles published in magazines, newspapers and periodicals, catalogs of different exhibitions, and a list of unpublished articles and conferences about Lorenzo Domínguez. The book also includes photographs taken by Lorenzo Domínguez of his own drawings and embossed metal plates on Easter Island themes, and some of his photographs of the Island\\'s moais and petroglyphs.\\r\\n2. Lorenzo Domínguez also left a diary about his stay in Easter Island, a journal of both personal and artistic inspiration written in the form of letters to his wife Clara (Lorenzo Dominguez. Diario de la Isla de Pascua, Cuadernos 1960-1961). The journal begins with the artist\\'s words of salute to Clara while the ship \"Presidente Pinto\" leaves towards the Island on January 11 of 1960. Along three hundred pages Domínguez registers his aesthetic reflections and his personal emotions upon contemplating the Island\\'s moais and petroglyphs; he speaks about the urgent need to preserve this artistic patrimony; he tells his wife about his own creative process, and gives details about what he is sculpting and drawing and about the photographs that he is taking. But the artist also writes about his everyday life in the Island, about the people he meets, about what he eats or reads, about his travels on horse back accompanied by his guide, Santiago Pakarati, and about his personal feelings of longing and love for his wife and family. The diary ends on February 7 of 1961.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhotographs: the Easter Island Domínguez Collection (University of California, Los Angeles)\\r\\nLorenzo Domínguez left a photographic testimony of the Island\\'s artistic patrimony, since he took several hundreds of black-and-white or color photographs, before and after the tsunami that in May 1960 damaged part of the Island\\'s heritage. Today, many of these photographs are part of the database of the UCLA Easter Island Statue Project, directed by Dr. Jo Anne Van Tilburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks in museums\\r\\nCajal, Madrid, Spain.

He was the founding director and later emeritus director of the Institute of USA and Canada of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (ISKRAN), the Soviet and Russian think tank for the study of US and Canada.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly career\\r\\nArbatov was born the son of a Bolshevik, Arkady Arbatov (1898–1954), who was of Jewish origin. His father was part of several Soviet trade missions in the 1930s. Arbatov fought in the Red Army during World War II, taking part in the Revolution Day parade on Red Square on 7 November 1941 and heading from there to the front lines. Arbatov finished the war as chief of staff of the 17th Guards mortar regiment and was awarded the Order of the Red Star in 1943.\\r\\nWhile recuperating from tuberculosis in 1944, Arbatov was in a hospital and read an item in a newspaper report stating that a state institute of international relations was being created in Moscow. He applied to attend the school and graduated from the Moscow State Institute of International Relations in 1949, he was awarded a Ph.D. from the same institute in 1954. He worked as a journalist and commentator on foreign affairs between 1953 and 1963 at Kommunist and the English language publication The New Times.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical scientist\\r\\nArbatov worked at the institute of global economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1963-64. He was founder director of the Institute for US and Canadian Studies (ISKRAN) from 1965 to 1995. He was appointed director emeritus of the ISKRAN in 1995. He was appointed adviser to the Central Committee of the CPSU on US matters in 1964-67. He was elected to the Central Committee in 1990 and served in the Supreme Soviet. As an adviser to five General Secretaries of the Communist Party, Arbatov was a frequent participant in arms control negotiations conducted between the US and USSR. According to the CIA, Arbatov was an intermediary between the Politburo and the KGB.\\r\\n\\r\\nArbatov became the face of the Soviet Union in the West, where he used his strong, though heavily accented, command of the English language to help foster ties with American officials and to present Soviet views to the American public, sparring on American television with such individuals as General Bernard Rogers, the former commander of NATO regarding the military deterrent in Western Europe to Soviet forces. Billy Graham, who had called communism \"satanic\", said that he had \"met a very wonderful official here\" after spending three hours together during Graham\\'s 1982 visit to Moscow. Arbatov expressed sharp criticism of the Reagan administration, saying that it conducted a \"campaign of demonization, of dehumanization of the other side\", remarks that led to difficulties for Arbatov in obtaining visas to enter the United States during that period.\\r\\nIn his 1992 autobiography The System: An Insider\\'s Life in Soviet Politics, Arbatov credited himself as one of those individuals who had worked to implement reform \"from the inside, and not from the outside, of the system\" that laid the groundwork for the reforms implemented in the 1980s by Mikhail Gorbachev. Sergey Rogov, who succeeded him in 1995 as director of the Institute for U.S.A. and Canada Studies called Arbatov someone who \"was probably willing more than anybody else to stick his neck out\" to mitigate the influence of anti-American hard liners in the Soviet regime, though \"he knew pretty well what were the red lines that he could not cross publicly, and he was very cautious about it\". Arbatov recognized that the Soviet Union had lost the Cold War, but insisted that the United States had suffered too by losing \"The Enemy\", a main adversary consisting of one country on which to concentrate efforts.\\r\\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Arbatov was an adviser to the State Duma and a member of the foreign policy council of the Foreign Ministry of the Russian Federation between 1991 and 1996. He was a supporter of the transfer of the southern Kuril Islands to Japan. Arbatov was a critic of the economic reforms implemented by Boris Yeltsin, saying that they placed too much economic and political power in the hands of an unelected few at the expense of the middle class in Russia. He also was a critic of Vladimir Putin\\'s efforts to suppress the democratic movement in Russia.\\r\\nArbatov was a participant in the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal life and recognition\\r\\nArbatov was awarded two Orders of Lenin, an Order of the October Revolution, two Orders of the Red Banner of Labour and other medals.\\r\\nArbatov died at age 87 on 1 October 2010 in Moscow due to cancer. He was survived by his wife, Svetlana, as well as by his son Aleksei, who also became involved with arms control issues and became a Duma member.\\r\\n\\r\\nPublished work\\r\\nArbatov was the author of over 100 published works:\\r\\n\\r\\nИдеологическая борьба в современных международных отношениях.

Another journalist, Marvin T�nchez, was an injured victim of them same attack but survived. In the same area, camera operator Giovanni Guido Villatoro was killed in an unrelated crime just days after the deadly attack on the first three journalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath\\r\\nThe three journalists attacked were covering an event for International Women\\'s Day. Two suspected gunmen on a motorbike killed two journalists and injured the other while in Mazatenango Park, Mazatenango, Guatemala. The attack occurred at approximately 12:45 p.m., 10 March 2015. In all four shots were fired by the gunman. Danilo L�pez was shot twice and died on the scene. Frederico Salazar was shot in the back and died later at the hospital. Marvin T�nchez was injured by one shot fired in the incident.\\r\\nAccording to T�nchez, L�pez was the intended target of the attack. Lopez identified the source of threats against him as coming from Jos� Linares Rojas, mayor of San Lorenzo, Suchitep�quez. The mayor was said to have made this threat as early as July 2013, which was reported on then by Prensa Libre with the headline, \"Mayor Threatens Journalist\". L�pez repeated this claim in an interview in February 2014 and the Guatemala Human Rights Commission also made this claim after his murder.\\r\\n\\r\\nVictims\\r\\nDanilo Efra�n Zap�n L�pez studied at Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. He was survived by his 5-year-old daughter, and his wife was pregnant at the time of his murder. L�pez was a reporter for the Guatemala City daily Prensa Libre for about 10 years. He covered politics, sports and other news but he often reported on corruption with politicians and use of public funds. He had been receiving threats since 2013 but had called the attorney general\\'s office for assistance an hour before the attack.\\r\\nFederico Salazar was a reporter and radio journalist for the Guatemala City station Nuevo Mundo radio for the last 3 years.\\r\\nBoth L�pez and Salazar were leaders of the Suchitepequez Press Association in Guatemala. L�pez was its vice-president. Salazar served as its secretary.\\r\\nMarvin T�nchez  is a reporter for a local Canal 30 cable TV station on channel 23 in Guatemala. He also reported for a  newspaper called Publinews.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerpetrators\\r\\nShortly after the murder on 10 March, police arrested two suspects in connection to the murders of L�pez and Salazar. An image of the two fleeing the scene on a motorcycle was captured on video at the event. The first occurred hours after the attack when Sergio Valdemar Cardona Reyes, 31, considered a suspect, was arrested on a blue motorcycle in Cuyotenango, Suchitep�quez Department. He was accused at his hearing of being the driver. Later, Artemio de Jes�s Ram�rez Torres, alias \"El Barbas\" or \"Fluff\", 29, was captured by police in the village of El Carmen, Champerico, Retalhuleu Department. He was accused at his hearing of being the shooter.\\r\\nThe prosecution said in March the identities of the source who ordered the attack was still under investigation. In June 2015, three more suspects were arrested in connection with the murder, including two members of the Polic�a Nacional Civil de Guatemala. They were Jorge Le�n Cabrera Sol�s and Artemio de Jes�s Ju�rez Pichiy�. The prosecutor said Ju�rez Pichiy�\\'s phone number was linked with the suspected perpetrators. The third arrested was German Am�lcar Morataya Beltr�n.\\r\\n\\r\\nContext\\r\\nGuatemala and Honduras rank high among countries in Central America with the most unsolved murders involving journalists. Many arrests have been made but no convictions.\\r\\nGuatemala is historically one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. According to the Guatemala Human Rights Commission, 342 journalists were killed over the 36 years of the Guatemalan Civil War. More recently, 2014 World Press Freedom Index ranked Guatemala 125 out of 180 countries. The committee to Protect Journalists lists 22 journalists who have been killed confirmed or unconfirmed as a result of their journalism in Guatemala since 1992. The Inter American Press Association (IAPA) reported during Guatemalan President Otto P�rez Molina\\'s government alone, seven journalists have been killed, four in 2013 and three on the week of 10 March 2015. From 2012 to 2015 during his term, there have been more than 200 attacks against journalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact\\r\\nDanilo L�pez received a number of threats from politicians throughout his career. The Unit for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders in Guatemala revealed that L�pez first reported being threatened in 2008, when the ex-governor of the department of Suchitep�quez, Leonor Toledo allegedly threatened him by phone following critical reports of the department\\'s management. Another article by L�pez in 2011 caused then-mayor of Mazatenango, Juan Manuel Delgado, to attack the journalist in the street.\\r\\n\\r\\nReactions\\r\\nIrina Bokova, director-general of UNESCO, said, \"The cold-blooded murder of Danilo Lopez and Federico Salazar must not go unpunished. Press freedom and freedom of expression are backbones to democratic societies, where citizens can count on being kept informed, where they have a voice. Defending these rights means journalists must be able to work without fearing for their lives. Criminals must know that their acts will be punished.\"\\r\\nGuatemala Human Rights Commission said, \"The Guatemalan government is directly responsible for these assassinations; its inaction has allowed previous attacks against journalists to remain unsolved. This impunity has opened the door for countless cases of spurious criminal charges to be made against journalist and, as a result, there has been an increase in the censure and silencing of journalists. The government has been negligent in the development of a Protection Program for Human Rights Defenders...\"\\r\\nMiguel �ngel M�ndez Zetina, director of Prensa Libre, said, \"We\\'re alerting the international community that it\\'s time that as Guatemalans we be more concerned about the terrible climate of insecurity and ungovernability that we are experiencing in this country.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMemorial\\r\\nA memorial was constructed at the park where the two journalists were murdered.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nList of journalists killed in Guatemala\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Angelo Agostini (8 April 1843 – 23 January 1910) was an Italian-born Brazilian illustrator, journalist and founder of several publications, and although born in Italy, is considered the first Brazilian cartoonist.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nAgostini was born in Vercelli, Italy, but following adolescence and art studies in Paris, he arrived in Brazil in 1859 with his mother the singer Raquel Agostini, and settled.\\r\\nAt an early age, he published drawn work in the São Paulo publication Diabo Coxo on 17 September 1864. Following more work published in Cabrião and Revista Arlequim, Agostini produced a sequential image story serialised in Vida Fluminense titled As Aventuras de Nhô Quim (The Adventures of Nhô Quim). The first chapter published on 30 January 1869, the story involved themes of conflict between the agricultural and urban culture, and political commentary through visual storytelling capable of reaching a largely illiterate population.\\r\\nDuring the 1880s Agostini started the periodical Revista Illustrada, which became noted for its illustrated coverage of the annual Carnival. On 27 January 1883, the first chapter of As Aventuras do Zé Caipora (The Adventures of Zé Caipora) was published, starting a successful publication run of 35 episodes spread out over many years,. Achieving a multimedia impact, the series was printed in four editions, and inspired a popular song and two silent films. \\r\\nAgostini established the magazine Don Quixote in 1895, which lasted until 1906, and with Luiz Bartolomeu de Sousa e Silva founded the influential youth magazine O Tico-Tico for publisher O Malho in 1905.

He was born in Viipuri and was of Baltic German origin. Krohn worked as a lecturer on Finnish language in Helsinki University from the year 1875 and as a supernumerary  professor from 1885. He was one of the most notable researchers into Finnish folk poetry in the 19th century. His native language was German.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife\\r\\nKrohn\\'s mother was Julie Dannenberg, a daughter of the Baltic German family at Kiiskil� manor near Vyborg. The versatile and talented Julie spoke eight languages and played the piano brilliantly. \\r\\nThe other half of Julie Dannenberg\\'s family was of Ingrian background.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks and influence\\r\\nKrohn mostly preferred not to write under his foreign surname, but either adopted a pen name or worked as part of a collective, such as the fennomans, of which he was a leading member. Using pseudonyms, he translated many of Johan Ludvig Runeberg\\'s works into Finnish, and researchers also concluded that he penned the Finnish lyrics for the Finnish national anthem.\\r\\nUnder his most notable pseudonym Suonio he published poetry; e.g. Mansikoita ja mustikoita 1856�61 (\"Strawberries and blueberries\") and Kuun tarinoita (\"Tales of the moon\"). As Suonio, he worked as editor of Suomen Kuvalehti and translated many of Sir Walter Scott\\'s novels, such as A Legend of Montrose.\\r\\n\\r\\nScientific work\\r\\nAn important contribution to a history of Finnish literature was Krohn\\'s doctoral thesis Suomenkielinen runollisuus ruotsinvallan aikana (1862).\\r\\nKrohn was also the first to develop a scientific method for the study of folklore, the historic-geographic method. This method, which is connected with nationalist understandings of folk culture, involves careful comparison of variant texts of an item of folklore to the end of identifying the \"original\" version (as well as its origin)\\r\\nJulius Krohn died by drowning in Bay of Vyborg in a yachting accident at the age of 53. His work with folklore and the Finnish language was continued by his son Kaarle Krohn, who published much of his scientific work posthumously. This work was further developed by their student Antti Aarne.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren\\r\\nApart from Krohn\\'s son Kaarle, mentioned above, his son Ilmari became a composer of church music.\\r\\nHis daughter Aino married the Estonian nationalist Oskar Kallas and was known as a writer by the name Aino Kallas.

It originally aired on FX in the United States on April 9, 2014.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot\\r\\nAfter consulting with Arkady and Oleg, and with the promise of coaching from Oleg, Nina tells Stan that she will take the FBI\\'s polygraph test. Oleg suggests a few techniques including that she visualize him in the room as well as clenching her anus. During the polygraph test, the FBI asks if she knows who killed Vlad. She answers yes while looking at Stan knowingly. After she passes, she declines Stan\\'s offer to get her out of the embassy, saying that she will be able to help him more after she is read into the Illegals Program. It is revealed that Nina and Oleg were planning this together. They celebrate their success and have sex in a hotel room.\\r\\nKate relays orders for Philip to bug the ARPANET. Philip recruits the help of Charles Duluth, an alcoholic conservative journalist who is also a KGB agent. Posing as a journalist, Philip first meets with a computer scientist at a university to learn the details of ARPANET. Later, Philip and Duluth break into the university to plant the bug. Philip is forced to set off the alarms in order to enter the computer lab undetected, but is forced to kill one of the employees when they return to grab their wallet. Philip later finds Duluth drinking at the bar. Duluth expresses exhilaration over the success of the mission, and a more reserved Philip reveals he was forced to kill the worker.\\r\\nWith Philip watching afar with a sniper rifle, Larrick tells Elizabeth that he has been ordered to Nicaragua, to set up a base and mine the harbor of Managua, but he will still be able to let them into the Contra training camp before he leaves.  Lucia is upset to learn this, because (as she tells Elizabeth) she planned to kill Larrick there in revenge for his atrocities in Nicaragua. Elizabeth tells her that Larrick is more valuable as a cooperating asset, and expresses her doubts about Lucia\\'s reliability to Philip.\\r\\nHenry observes a neighbor\\'s house with his telescope, and sneaks in to play Intellivision while they are gone, something his parents had forbidden him from doing.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction\\r\\nDevelopment\\r\\nIn March 2014, FX confirmed that the seventh episode of the season would be titled \"Arpanet\", and that it would be written by Joshua Brand, and directed by Kevin Dowling. This was Brand\\'s fifth writing credit, and Dowling\\'s first directing credit.\\r\\n\\r\\nReception\\r\\nViewers\\r\\nIn its original American broadcast, \"Arpanet\" was seen by an estimated 1.18 million household viewers with a 0.4 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 0.4 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode. This was a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.21 million household viewers with a 0.4 in the 18-49 demographics.\\r\\n\\r\\nCritical reviews\\r\\n\"Arpanet\" received critical acclaim. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a \"great\" 8.8 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \"The Americans looking at the beginning of what will become the internet is an inherently interesting idea that it was fun to see the show explore. Meanwhile, Nina\\'s dangerous situation taking that polygraph test and Philip once again forced to kill to protect a mission was a reminder of just how perilous a life these people are living and how it can come crashing down at any time.\"\\r\\nAlan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote, \"Machines also don\\'t have the qualms with killing that men do, but in 1982 the dirty work still has to be done by complicated men and women like Philip and Nina, and Andrew Larrick. And that\\'s hard on all of them, but very entertaining for us.\" The A.V. Club gave the episode an \"A–\" grade and wrote, \"\\'Arpanet\\' is marvelously tense throughout, even when the characters are almost too stupid to be believed. Hell, the episode gains tension just from watching Henry sit around in a house the neighbors have left empty, playing Intellivision.\"\\r\\nMatt Zoller Seitz of Vulture gave the episode a 4 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"\\'ARPANET\\' is a tight, propulsive episode of The Americans, a show that produces little else. Written by Joshua Brand and directed by Kevin Dowling, it also moves the story forward politically, moving it deeper into the \\'80s and closer to the end of the Cold War — not that anyone involved in this tale has any idea that there will be an end.\" Carla Day of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.6 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \"Nina was by far the best part of \\'Arpanet\\'. I love her anytime she\\'s on the screen. She\\'s turned into quite a force to be reckoned with. She has gone from a woman forced to betray her homeland to a woman who has men on both side wrapped around her finger.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\"Arpanet\" at FX\\r\\n\"Arpanet\" at IMDb', 'Ernesto Cardenal Martínez (20 January 1925 – 1 March 2020) was a Nicaraguan Catholic priest, poet, and politician. He was a liberation theologian and the founder of the primitivist art community in the Solentiname Islands, where he lived for more than ten years (1965–1977). A former member of the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, he was Nicaragua\\'s minister of culture from 1979 to 1987. He was prohibited from administering the sacraments in 1984 by Pope John Paul II, but rehabilitated by Pope Francis in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nCardenal was born into an upper-class family in Granada, Nicaragua. He studied at Colegio Centro América in Nicaragua. One of his brothers was fellow priest Fernando Cardenal. A first cousin of the poet Pablo Antonio Cuadra, Cardenal studied literature in Managua and then from 1942 to 1946 in Mexico and from 1947 to 1949 in New York City. In 1949 and 1950, he traveled through Italy, Spain and Switzerland.\\r\\nIn July 1950, he returned to Nicaragua, where he participated in the 1954 April Revolution against Anastasio Somoza García\\'s regime. The coup d\\'état failed and ended with the deaths of many of his associates. After a deep mystical experience that Cardenal had on June,2, 1956, in 1957 he entered the Trappist Monastery of Gethsemani (Kentucky, United States), joining another poet-priest, Thomas Merton, who was the master of novices; but in 1959, he left to study theology in Cuernavaca, Mexico.\\r\\n\\r\\nPriesthood\\r\\nCardenal was ordained a Catholic priest in 1965 in Granada. He went to the Solentiname Islands, where he founded a Christian, almost-monastic, mainly-peasant community, which eventually led to the founding of the artists\\' colony. The colony engaged with painting as well as sculpture and was visited many times by artists and writers of the region such as Willarson Brandt, Julio Cortázar, Asilia Guillén, and Aedes Margarita. It was there that the famous book El Evangelio en Solentiname (The Gospel in Solentiname) was written. Cardenal collaborated closely with the leftist Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional (Sandinista National Liberation Front, or FSLN) in working to overthrow Anastasio Somoza Debayle\\'s regime.\\r\\n\\r\\nNicaraguan Revolution\\r\\nMany members of the Solentiname community engaged in the revolutionary process through guerrilla warfare that the FSLN had developed to strike at the regime. The year 1977 was crucial to Cardenal\\'s community, when Somoza\\'s National Guard, as a result of an attack to the headquarters stationed in the city of San Carlos a few kilometres from the community, raided Solentiname and burned it to the ground. Cardenal fled to Costa Rica.\\r\\nCardenal was a believer in Christian communism saying \"Christ led me to Marx...for me, the four Gospels are all equally Communist. I’m a Marxist who believes in God, follows Christ and is a revolutionary for his Kingdom\". He later said \"The Bible is full of revolutions. The prophets are people with a message of revolution. Jesus of Nazareth takes the revolutionary message of the prophets. And we also will continue trying to change the world and make revolution. Those revolutions failed, but others will come\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 19 July 1979, immediately after the Liberation of Managua, he was named Minister of Culture by the new Sandinista government. He campaigned for a \"revolution without vengeance.\" His brother Fernando Cardenal, also a Catholic priest (in the Jesuit order), was appointed Minister of Education. When Pope John Paul II visited Nicaragua in 1983, he openly scolded Ernesto Cardenal, who knelt before him on the Managua airport runway, for resisting his order to resign from the government, and admonished him: \"Usted tiene que arreglar sus asuntos con la Iglesia\" (\"You must fix your affairs with the Church\"). On 4 February 1984 Pope John Paul II suspended Cardenal a divinis because of Cardenal\\'s refusal to leave his political office. This suspension remained in effect until it was lifted by Pope Francis in 2019. Cardenal remained Minister of Culture until 1987, when his ministry was closed for economic reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater career\\r\\nCardenal left the FSLN in 1994, protesting the authoritarian direction of the party under Daniel Ortega, calling it a \"robbery of the people and dictatorship not a revolutionary movement\" when he left the government. He was a member of the Movimiento de Renovación Sandinista (Sandinista Renovation Movement, or MRS) that participated in the 2006 Nicaraguan general election. Days before the election, Cardenal explained his decision: \"I think more desirable an authentic capitalism, as Montealegre\\'s [Eduardo Montealegre, the presidential candidate for Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance] would be, than a false Revolution.\"\\r\\nHe was also a member of the board of advisers of the Latin American television station teleSUR.\\r\\nCardenal was a polemical figure in Nicaragua\\'s literary and cultural history. He has been described as \"the most important poet right now in Latin America\" politically and poetically. He was a vocal representative for Nicaragua and a key to understanding the contemporary literary and cultural life of Nicaragua. He participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007. During a short visit to India, he made a profound impression on a group of writers called the Hungry generation.\\r\\nCardenal\\'s tour of the United States in 2011 to promote his newest work stirred up some controversy, as with the American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family and Property that protested his appearances at Catholic schools such as Xavier University in Cincinnati, Ohio, because of his Marxist ideology.\\r\\nOn 18 February 2019, Archbishop Waldemar Sommertag, the Vatican nuncio in Nicaragua, announced that Pope Francis had ended Cardenal\\'s suspension and that Cardenal was \"granted with benevolence the absolution of all canonical censures\". His return to ministry was also confirmed by Managua Auxiliary Bishop Silvio Báez, who stated “I visited my friend priest, Father Ernesto Cardenal, in the hospital, with whom I could talk for a few minutes. After praying for him, I knelt in his bed and asked for his blessing as a priest of the Catholic Church, to which he agreed joyfully. Thank you, Ernesto! ”\\r\\nOn 1 March 2020, Cardenal died due to complications from ongoing heart and kidney problems. His funeral was held in the Managua Cathedral on March 3, 2020, and was disrupted by at least 100 pro-Ortega protestors who shouted \"viva Daniel\" and \"traitor\" at his Nicaraguan flag-draped casket. To avoid further harassment, Cardenal\\'s burial was held in secret. At his request, Cardenal\\'s remains were cremated and then buried in the community he founded on the Solentiname Islands.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoetry\\r\\nEarlier works were focused on life and love; however, some works like \"Zero Hour\" had a direct correlation to his Marxist political ideas, being tied to the assassination of guerrilla leader Augusto César Sandino. Cardenal\\'s poetry also was heavily influenced by his unique Catholic ideology, mainly liberation theology. Some of his latest works are heavily influenced by his understanding of science and evolution, though it is still in dialogue with his earlier Marxist and Catholic material.  Cardenal sums up his later material in a PBS NewsHour interview:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, one matures, and can write about things one couldn\\'t before. One couldn\\'t get poetry out of this theme or this situation. And later, you can do it because you have more technical ability to do it. Now I can do easily things that were impossible for me to do when I was younger. That also happens to painters, I guess, and to all artists and creators. Even politicians mature and become, perhaps, more astute or more cunning.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonours\\r\\n1980: Peace Prize of the German Book Trade\\r\\nNovember 1990: Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award\\r\\n2005: Nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature\\r\\n2009: Ibero-American Poetry Prize Pablo Neruda\\r\\n2009: GLOBArt Award in the monastery church in Pernegg\\r\\n2010: Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class\\r\\n2012: Queen Sofia Prize for Ibero-American Poetry\\r\\n2018: Mario Benedetti International Award\\r\\n\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nBooks in English\\r\\nThe Psalms of Struggle and Liberation, (Translator, Emile G.

He was the editor of La Prensa, the only significant opposition newspaper to the long rule of the Somoza family.  He is a 1977 laureate of the Maria Moors Cabot Prize of Columbia University in New York. He married Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who later went on to become President of Nicaragua (1990–1997). In 1978, he was shot to death, one of the precipitating events of the overthrow of the Somoza regime the following year.\\r\\n\\r\\nBackground\\r\\nChamorro was a son of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Zelaya and wife Margarita Cardenal Argüello and paternal grandson of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Bolaños and wife Ana María Zelaya Bolaños. He was the maternal grandson of Salvador Cardenal Saborío (son of Pedro Cardenal Ayerdi and wife Ana Ma. Saborio Bonilla), and wife Isabel Argüello Prado (daughter of Pedro Argüello Argüello and wife Leocadia Parado y Méndez). Both were relatives of Leonardo Argüello, 66th President of Nicaragua. His great-grandparents were Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Alfaro, 39th President of Nicaragua, and wife María de la Luz Bolaños Bendaña.\\r\\nHe had two brothers, Jaime Chamorro Cardenal and Xavier Chamorro Cardenal, and two sisters, Ligia Chamorro Cardenal, married to Samuel Barreto Argüello (grandchild of president Leonardo Arguello) and Ana María Chamorro Cardenal, married to Carlos Holmann Thompson (son of Edgard T. Holmann Reinecke and wife Carolina Thompson Gutierrez) from San Juan del Sur, parents of Eduardo, Verónica, Hugo Martín, Ana Carolina, Bruno, Ericka, and Juan Lorenzo Holmann Chamorro.\\r\\n\\r\\nMurder and legacy\\r\\nChamorro wrote a letter in 1975 to Somoza: \"I am waiting, with a clear conscience, and a soul at peace, for the blow you are to deliver.\" Three years later, in January 1978, Chamorro was killed by unknown gunmen who pulled up beside him in a car and opened fire with shotguns. Somoza claimed Chamorro was assassinated by Pedro Ramos, a Cuban-American entrepreneur whose business had been attacked by La Prensa. At the time, however, the Chamorro family and the  wealthy opposition held that Somoza had ordered him killed. Ramos took refuge in Miami, where he died. He was tried in absentia and found guilty of murder after the revolution, but he never returned to Nicaragua.\\r\\nAt his funeral, thousands of people followed the coffin from Managua\\'s Oriental Hospital to the Chamorro family home, taking turns carrying it.\\r\\nFollowing Chamorro\\'s murder, an estimated 30,000 people rioted in the streets of Managua. Cars were set on fire and several buildings belonging to the Somoza family were attacked. A general strike was called. Outside the capital, unrest flared in a number of cities and towns, particularly in areas where National Guardsmen had massacred peasant farmers during the counterinsurgency effort. The government responded with further violence and reintroduced martial law censorship. During 1978, there were seven machine gun attacks and attempted bombings of La Prensa, now under the management of Chamorro\\'s widow, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro. Following Somoza\\'s overthrow, she was a part of the FSLN-based junta from 1979 to 1980. She later broke with the FSLN and was elected president of Nicaragua in 1990.\\r\\nSpeaking about her husband to the participants of the 1998 IPI World Congress in Moscow, Violeta said: \"During his whole life, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro was a tireless fighter for democracy in Nicaragua and against the dictatorship of Somoza.

He was a former member of the Comintern and the  Balkan Communist Federation. He was associated with the Fan S. Noli government in 1924 and became the leader of the Bashkimi organization after the death of Avni Rustemi in 1924. In 1928 he helped establish the Korçë Communist Group. In the fierce rivalry for power control within the Communist Party, he was branded a Trotskyist and purged from the party.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nFundo was born in Görice (now Korçë, Albania) to a family of merchants originating from Moscopole, of Aromanian origin. He attended the French Lycée of Salonica and later studied law in Paris, France. He was the mentor to other Albanian Communist students in Paris, including future Albanian leader Enver Hoxha, to whom he taught law.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to Albania in 1924\\r\\nUpon returning to Albania he was a member of Avni Rrustemi\\'s Bashkimi organization which he later took over upon Rrustemi\\'s death by assassination in April 1924. Fundo developed connections with Orthodox Bishop Fan S. Noli and played an active role in forcing then-Prime Minister Ahmet Zogu\\'s exile to Yugoslavia that same year. Upon the overthrow of Noli\\'s government in November 1924, Fundo emigrated to Vienna, Austria, becoming member of KONARE  thus acquainted with the Balkan Communist Federation, and then emigrated to the Soviet Union where he became a member of the Comintern.\\r\\n\\r\\nOrganization of the Korçë Albanian Communist Group\\r\\nIn 1929 he took part in the 8th Congress of the Balkan Communist Federation where he discussed the founding of a Communist Party in Albania, having helped establish the Albanian Communist Group in 1928 in Korçë. From 1930 to 1931 he served as a journalist for the Vienna-based magazine The Balkan Federation.\\r\\n\\r\\n1933-1939: anti-Stalinism and expulsion from Comintern\\r\\nIn 1933 while in Germany he was a partial observer of the Reichstag fire events and traveled with Leipzig Trial participant Georgi Dimitrov (whom he befriended) back to Moscow. During the Spanish Civil War he organized Albanian volunteers for the International Brigades. During these years Fundo began criticizing the pro-Stalin wing of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union as \"Stalinist\", gravitating more towards the views of Leon Trotsky. During the Great Purge he was expelled from the Comintern in 1938 as a \"bourgeois deviationist\" and a death sentence was announced against him. However, the intercession of Georgi Dimitrov, then leader of the Comintern, resulted in this sentence being dropped.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to Albania in 1939\\r\\nFollowing the Italian invasion of Albania in 1939, Fundo returned to Albania and served as a secondary school teacher in his hometown of Korçë until his dismissal a year later, as he was a participant in the underground struggles against the Italians. By this time he had become disillusioned with Communism and embraced social-democracy. He was subsequently arrested in 1941 and sent to the island of Ventotene. Fundo became acquainted with Altiero Spinelli and Sandro Pertini during this period, the latter urging Fundo to stay and fight with the Italian resistance. As the Fascist government began to fall in 1943 however, Fundo was able to return to Albania.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath in 1944 by Albanian Communists\\r\\nIn September 1944 he was captured in southern Yugoslavia, then allegedly handed over by Josip Broz Tito to the guerrillas of the Communist Party of Albania under Enver Hoxha. He was accused of Trotskyism and collaboration with British Intelligence. He was then either lashed or beaten to death. According to Enver Hoxha in his memoirs, however, he was found by the Albanian National Liberation Army in the company of a \"gang of bandits\" led by anti-communist partisan Kryeziu Brothers and a British officer, an account that has since been substantiated. The Yugoslav partisans, who in 1942 had told their Albanian counterparts to \"expose\" Fundo, then allegedly came out in Fundo\\'s defense and demanded that Hoxha\\'s army hand Fundo over to them, but by then their letter had arrived too late as Fundo had already been executed.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n‘Enverists’ and ‘Titoists’ - I has a section on Fundo.', 'The Great Beauty (Italian: La grande bellezza [la ˈɡrande belˈlettsa]) is a 2013 art drama film co-written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino. Filming took place in Rome starting on 9 August 2012. It premiered at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival where it was screened in competition for the Palme d\\'Or. It was shown at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, the 2013 Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival (winning Grand Prix), and at the 2013 Reykjavik European Film Festival.\\r\\nThe film won Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globe and the BAFTA award in the same category. It is a co-production between the Italian Medusa Film and Indigo Film and the French Babe Films, with support from Banca Popolare di Vicenza, Pathé and France 2 Cinéma. With a production budget of €9.2 million, the film grossed over $24 million worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlot\\r\\nThe film opens with a quote from Louis-Ferdinand Céline\\'s novel Journey to the End of the Night: \"Travel is useful; it exercises the imagination. All the rest is disappointment and fatigue. Our journey is entirely imaginary. That is its strength. It goes from life to death. People, animals, cities, things – all are imagined. It\\'s a novel, just a fictitious narrative. Littré says so, and he\\'s never wrong. And besides, in the first place, anyone can do as much. You just have to close your eyes. It\\'s on the other side of life.\"\\r\\nJep Gambardella is a 65-year-old seasoned journalist and theater critic, a fascinating man, mostly committed to wandering among the social events of a Rome immersed in the beauty of its history and in the superficiality of its inhabitants today, in a merciless contrast. He also ventured into creative writing in his youth: he is the author of only one work called The Human Apparatus. Despite the appreciation and the many awards he received, Jep has not written other books, not only for his laziness but above all for a creative block from which he cannot escape. The purpose of his existence has been to become a \"socialite\", but not just any socialite, but \"the king of society\".\\r\\nJep is surrounded by several friends: Romano, a playwright who is perpetually on the leash of a young woman who exploits him; Lello, a mouthy and wealthy toy seller; Viola, a wealthy bourgeois and mother of a son with serious mental problems named Andrea; Stefania, a self-centred radical chic writer; Dadina, the dwarf editor of the newspaper where Jep works.\\r\\nOne morning, he meets the husband of Elisa, a woman who has been Jep\\'s first and probably only love: the man announces that Elisa has died, leaving behind only a diary in which the woman tells of her love for Jep; thus, her husband discovered that he had been a mere surrogate for 35 years, nothing more than \"a good companion\". Elisa\\'s husband, now afflicted and grieved, will soon find consolation in the affectionate welcome of his foreign maid. After this episode, Jep begins a profound and melancholic reinterpretation of his life and a long meditation on himself and on the world around him. And, above all, he thinks about starting to write again.\\r\\nDuring the following days, Jep meets Ramona, a stripper with painful secrets, and Cardinal Bellucci, in whom the passion for cooking is more alive than his Catholic faith; Jep is gradually convinced of the futility and uselessness of his existence. Soon his \"vicious circle\" also breaks down: Ramona, with whom he had established an innocent and profound relationship, dies of an incurable disease; Romano, disappointed by the deceptive attractiveness of Rome, leaves the city, farewelling only Jep; Stefania, humiliated by Jep, who had revealed her secrets and her lies to her face, left Jep\\'s worldly circle; Viola, on the other hand, after the death of her son, donates all her possessions to the Church and becomes a missionary in Africa.\\r\\nJust when hopes seem to abandon Jep once and for all, he is saved by a new episode: after a meeting, pushed by Dadina, who wants to get an interview with a \"Saint\", a Catholic missionary nun in the Third World, Jep goes to Giglio Island to report on the shipwreck of the Costa Concordia. Right here, remembering his first meeting with Elisa in a flashback, a glimmer of hope rekindles in him: his next novel is finally ready to come to light.\\r\\n\\r\\nCast\\r\\nMusic\\r\\nReception\\r\\nCritical response\\r\\nThe review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 91% approval rating, based on 135 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 8/10.

He likened it to Roberto Rossellini\\'s Rome, Open City and Federico Fellini\\'s La Dolce Vita in its ambition to record a period of Roman history on film. \"Rossellini covered the Nazi occupation of 1944; Fellini the seductive, empty hedonism of the years that followed. Sorrentino\\'s plan is to do the same for the Berlusconi era,\" he wrote. Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter stated \"Sorrentino\\'s vision of moral chaos and disorder, spiritual and emotional emptiness at this moment in time is even darker than Fellini\\'s (though Ettore Scola\\'s The Terrace certainly comes in somewhere).\" Critics have also identified other purposefully explicit film homages: to Roma, 8½, Scola\\'s Splendor, Michelangelo Antonioni\\'s La notte. Spanish film director Pedro Almodóvar named the film as one of the twelve best films of 2013, placing it second in his list.

He won the 1970 Salón de Artistas Colombianos. Rayo worked with abstract geometry primarily employing black, white, red and yellow. He was part of the Op Art movement. Rayo\\'s work shows that geometric art is as much a part of the past as it is of the future. He used traces of the past to discover new ways to present visual and geometric sketches.\\r\\nOne of his most celebrated exhibitions was carried out in the National Room of the Museum of the Palace of fine arts of Mexico, titled \"20 years, 100 works: Omar Rayo.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMuseum\\r\\nThe Museo Rayo de Dibujo y Grabado Latinoamericano was founded on January 20, 1981, by Rayo in his hometown of Roldanillo with funds the artist himself provided. The museum was also funded with help from the Colombian government and others so that this site would remain a permanent exhibit of his works of art during the late 1980s. The museum was designed by Mexican architect Leopoldo Gout and opened with a collection of 2,000 of Rayo\\'s artwork and some 500 other Latin American artists\\' works. The museum contains a library, many modules for expositions, a graphic arts workshop and a theater. Sadly government care has been diminishing, and Miss Agueda Pizarro had found a hard time carrying by with financial sustainment. Several activities are carried out by the foundation of the museum\\'s for promoting arts in the region.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal life\\r\\nRayo met New York-born poet Águeda Pizarro, almost fourteen years his junior, in New York in 1963. At the time Rayo was dating a friend of hers from university, but Rayo soon began going out with Pizarro instead, and she moved in with him in 1968. The couple divided their time between New York and Roldanillo, spending six months in each place. Their daughter Sara was born in 1977, at which point they made the decision to marry. Sara Rayo is now a successful artist in her own right.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath\\r\\nRayo suffered his first heart attack in 1998, and a more serious one in January 2006, which resulted in him spending 30 hours in a coma before recovering.\\r\\nOn the morning on June 7, 2010, Rayo collapsed during breakfast at his home in Roldanillo, according to the testimony of one of his assistants, Alejandro Mendoza. At the time his wife Águeda and daughter Sara were at Sara\\'s home in Cali. Rayo was taken to the local hospital where the cause of the collapse was identified as another heart attack. At the hospital he was resuscitated and transferred by ambulance to a hospital in the departmental capital Cali, but during the journey near the city of Palmira, Rayo\\'s condition deteriorated and his vital signs were lost; he was pronounced dead on arrival at the Valle de Lili hospital in Cali.\\r\\n\\r\\nTribute\\r\\nOn January 20, 2012, Google celebrated Rayo\\'s 84th birthday with a Google Doodle.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n(in Spanish) Museo Rayo\\r\\n(in Spanish) Latin Art Museum; Omar Rayo', 'Carmelo Arden Quin (né Carmelo Heriberto Alves; 16 March 1913 – 27 September 2010) was a Uruguayan artist. Arden Quin’s primary focuses were painting and poetry. From a young age, Arden Quin was an ambitious and idealistic artist. Today, Arden Quin is most recognized for his co-founding of the Madí movement, which began in Argentina but ultimately became an international movement. Arden Quin’s commitment to invention, rather than replication or representation, drove his relentless pursuit of new forms and ideas.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nIn 1913, Carmelo Arden Quin (born Carmelo Heriberto Alves) was born to a single mother in the border town of Rivera, Uruguay. Arden Quin\\'s father had been murdered while he was still in his mother\\'s womb, and in his stead three of Arden Quin\\'s uncles helped to raise the boy. From an early age, Arden Quin showed an aptitude for art, designing and selling colorful kites to classmates as early as age eleven. This initial interest was cultivated by his uncle Miguel, who himself was a painter and sculptor. Arden Quin also received rudimentary lessons in painting from a close family friend during his teenage years. During this same time, Arden Quin and his friends began to participate in political demonstrations, which would galvanize his enduring involvement in political causes.\\r\\nIn 1934, Arden Quin began to experiment in his uncle Miguel\\'s workshop. After painting a cubist work, Arden Quin had the idea to \"reform\" the painting\\'s rectangular shape. Taking a pair of scissors, Arden Quin began to cut pieces out of the border of his painting. This experiment would be the beginning of a long career of artistic innovation. In the same year, Arden Quin left his family in Rivera for the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nBefore Arden Quin moved to Buenos Aires during the late 1930s, he lived primarily in Montevideo, Uruguay, and also spent some time in Brazil. In Montevideo, Arden Quin frequented the cafés, or peñas, where painters and writers of the city gathered and discussed their works. In early 1935, a friend of Arden Quin invited him to a lecture at the Theosophical Society of Montevideo by Joaquín Torres-García, an esteemed and exceedingly well-traveled artist and the founder of the Universalismo movement, otherwise known as Universal Constructivism. He eagerly accepted the invitation and, after the lecture, Arden Quin\\'s friend introduced the passionate young poet and artist to Torres-García, who invited Arden Quin to visit him in his studio. Torres-García would provide invaluable guidance and inspiration for Arden Quin, and would directly influence Arden Quin\\'s development of Madí.\\r\\nIn 1937, Arden Quin left his home country for Buenos Aires, Argentina. Immediately, Arden Quin immersed himself in the culture of the city. As in Montevideo, he founded like-minded, motivated artists and political activists in the cafés, or tertulias, of Buenos Aires. Arden Quin also began to attend university art classes. Through his classes at the university and his time in the tertulias, the young artist and poet perpetually expanded his connections.\\r\\nIn this time his incubating plans for starting his own movement compelled him to recruit potential members. At the university Arden Quin would forge a friendship with poet Edgar Bayley. On a brief trip home to Uruguay in 1939 for an art exhibition, he would notice a young painter named Rhod Rothfuss. While working in a pencil factory in 1940, Arden Quin would meet a young Hungarian immigrant named Fernando Fallik, who would later be known to the art world as Gyula Kosice. These are among the few talents who would contribute to Arden Quin\\'s efforts in the publication of Arturo, a precursor to Madí.\\r\\nEarly in the 1940s, Arden Quin was provided the opportunity to travel upriver from Buenos Aires deep into the rain forest to seek a job opportunity with an Argentine-Brazilian coffee company that was attempting to expand operations into neighboring Paraguay. Always eager for adventure and the prospect of \"money-making schemes\", Arden Quin boarded a steamboat, and found himself in Asunción, Paraguay, three days later. Though he never found employment with the coffee company, Arden Quin\\'s experiences in Paraguay stimulated Arden Quin\\'s creativity, and galvanized an immensely productive year of his life. Upon returning, he would draft his first manifesto and a significant part of a long prose poem, both of which would be featured in his journal Arturo. In addition, he painted Les Formes Noires, a series of six paintings that would be considered some of the most mysterious of his entire career. These works, heavily influenced by his trip up the river, and by a visit to the Natural Sciences Museum in Argentina, feature black oil \"mask\" shapes on cardboard with a single \"eye\" in each.\\r\\n\\r\\nArturo\\r\\nIn the following years, Arden Quin\\'s Arturo idea would continue to take shape as he secured the contributions of many poets and artists. In 1942, the artist took a trip to Rio de Janeiro to continue these efforts. By the end of his visit, painter Maria Elena Vieira da Silva and poet Murilo Mendes provided contributions for the journal. Back in his home country, Arden Quin gathered a drawing, an essay, and two long poems from his friend Torres-García. He would also receive a poem from renowned Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro. At the end of the year, Arden Quin was back in Buenos Aires. There, he met the younger brother of Arturo collaborator Edgar Bayley, Tomás Maldonado. After showing Arden Quin around his studio, he was invited to join Arturo, and would end up designing the cover of the journal. With Maldonado came Lydia Prati, his fiancée, a talented young visual artist in her own respect. At this point, Arden Quin had garnered sufficient collaborators to finalize his plans for Arturo.\\r\\nArturo finally came to fruition in the summer of 1942. Approximately two hundred and fifty copies of the journal\\'s first and only issue were sold in Buenos Aires. Though the journal did not send any immediate ripples through the art world, its impact is nonetheless significant. The journal was a defiant break from avant-garde styles of the day. The heart of the journal and its art rested on the idea that \"meaning and signification\" should be rejected in favor of \"pure form\". If one word could encapsulate the spirit of Arturo, it would be \"invention\". The journal would ultimately provide a foundation for an entire generation of Latin American artists in the Rio de Plata area. Furthermore, Arturo represents a seminal work in the development of Madí.\\r\\n\\r\\nMadí\\r\\nIn 1946, before moving to Paris, Quin in collaboration with other artist and friends Martín Blaszko, Rhod Rothfuss, and Gyula Kosice, launched the Madí movement.  The movement\\'s main characteristics are: irregular frames, movable and displacing architecture, pan interval music composition and invented poetic propositions.  Madí encompassed painting as well as design, sculpture, and architecture. Just as important as the art produced in the Madí movement was the aesthetic philosophy.\\r\\nOn August 3, 1946, Arden Quin read his Madí manifesto to a group of critics, journalists, and others in his milieu at the French Institute for Higher Learning in Buenos Aires. Madi\\'s expressed purpose is to create an objective aesthetic reality through objective artistic elements. The manifesto, and indeed the movement, are rooted in Arden Quin\\'s commitment to activism and politics, as well as from the artistic and ideological ideas of Torres-Garcia and the Futurism movement in Italy. In addition, Arden Quin found substantial inspiration from Heraclitus\\' and Hegel\\'s theories of opposition, which explained how opposites remain in balance; how every thesis is balanced by an antithesis. The focus of Madí was also foundationally concrete, emphasizing the object and colors in themselves, rather than what they are perceived to represent. As described in his manifesto, Madí is a wide, cross-medium movement encapsulating poetry, art, theater, dance, and visual arts. Arden Quin provided a guiding framework for every form of Madí art. For example, he dictated that Madi drawings should be characterized as \"an arrangement of points and lines on a surface that creates form or a relationship of planes.\"\\r\\nThis announcement was followed by a three-day festival displaying Madí art. Here Arden Quin would debut many new creations, including a set of mobiles titled \"Escultura Movil Suspendida\" (\"Suspended Mobile Sculpture\"), a transformable wooden sculpture \"Escultura Amvobile\", and about half a dozen \"formes galbées\" pieces collectively titled \"Cosmopolis\", which vaguely depict aerial views of urban settings. The festival also included contributions from past collaborators Rhod Rothfuss and Gyula Kosice.\\r\\nIn 1947, the movement experienced a rift, as personal difficulties led to a divergence in the movement with Arden Quin going one direction and Rothfuss and Kosice going the other. In 1948, Arden Quin moved to Paris, and returned to Argentina in 1955 for a year, but in 1956, he moved indefinitely to Paris.\\r\\nIn Paris, Arden Quin continued Madí, producing many more works throughout lifetime. The movement continues today. In 1995, Arden Quin underscored that its lack of broad recognition has actually been the secret to its longevity and ideological consistency: \"Having never been taken over by the media, MADI has been able to travel through time in total independence.\" Today, Madí is represented by artists from several countries, including France, Hungary, Uruguay, Spain, Japan, Brazil and Venezuela. In 2003, the Madí Museum and Gallery opened in Dallas, Texas. The permanent collection includes twenty-five of Arden Quin\\'s works as well as pieces from eighteen other Madí artists spanning four continents.\\r\\nMany artists have been members of this international artistic movement since the 1940s until today, including Rhod Rothfuss, Juan Bay, Esteban Eitler, Diyi Laañ, Valdo Wellington, Rodolfo Uricchio, Gyula Kosice, Nelly Esquivel, J. P. Delmonte, Maria Bresler, Abraham Linenberg, Éva Bányász, Salvador Presta, Eduardo Sabelli, Nair Oliveira, Ana Maria Bay, Muñoz Cota, Jorge Rivera, Ricardo Humbert, Alberto Scopelliti, Lisl Steiner, Aldo Prior, Isa Muchnik, Ricardo Pereyra, Alberto Hidalgo, Grete Stern, Juan Carlos Paz, and Ramon Melgar.\\r\\nIn 1993, Arden Quin was included in the MOMA exhibit of \"Latin American Artists of the twentieth Century\". Several of Arden\\'s pieces can be found at the MADI Museum in Dallas, Texas. Arden Quin died in Paris in 2010. After his dead, he was granted the Honour Konex Award for his legacy in Visual Arts in Argentina.\\r\\n\\r\\nStyle\\r\\nArden Quin\\'s personal style is full of contrasting colors and geometric patterns. Some of the main characteristic concepts in Quin\\'s work are the irregular shaped frames called \"formes galbées\", which are alternations of concave and convex forms mainly in wood work; \"plastique blanche\", which are highly polished enameled wood pieces; and \"coplanals\", which are series of polygons forming a single piece that in some cases include moveable elements and sometimes remains static.\\r\\nArden Quin was committed to concrete art. This is accentuated best by an invitation to the Madí festival which read: \"We express nothing, we represent nothing, we symbolize nothing...This work is in space and time: IT EXISTS.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nHis first painting, Naturel Morte Cubiste (Cubist Still Life) was created in 1934. At the age of 21, he met his mentor, the Uruguayan sculptor Joaquín Torres García who was directly influenced by Piet Mondrian and Michael Seufor.\\r\\nIn 1948, after his partner Sofía Kunst became pregnant, Arden Quin painted for her what his biographer and friend Shelley Goodman would claim is \"arguably the most beautiful and certainly the most poignant work of his entire career.\" In his classic \"forme galbée\" style, Arden Quin painted nine \"lunas\" (moons) referring to the nine months of gestation, which would be collectively called \"forme galbée bleue\". The colors of the paintings depart significantly from his typical use of colors which were \"dark and clouded in tone\" in the style of \"European values.\" In \"forme galbée bleue,\" Arden Quin used vibrant blues, yellows, and whites.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nSantana, Raúl; Romeu Ordanza, Laura; Arden Quin, Sofía; Sagastizabal, Tencha (25 February 2014).

The stages of construction are illustrated with sections and cross-sections of the horse and rider, views of the statue from different angles, and details of armor and ornamentation. This bronze statue remains one of Lisbon's most important monuments, and dominates one of the major squares of Europe, the Praça do Comércio or Terreiro do Paço. In the introduction, Machado de Castro comments on similar works of art in the rest of Europe.\\r\\nMachado de Castro had a famous school and was the Master of many sculptors. He died in Lisbon.

He was part of the generation of Cuban artists that includes Wifredo Lam and Agustín Cárdenas, that studied at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes \"San Alejandro\", Havana, Cuba.  Carbonell\\'s inexhaustible vision and his ever-changing style is the product of a brilliant talent with an academic background.  Ceaselessly searching for the essence of form and the absence of details, he empowered a sense of strength and monumentality to his work.  Until the age of 92, he had continued to work daily in his studio.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildhood\\r\\nCarbonell was born on October 25, 1918, in Sancti Spiritus (\"Holy Spirit\"), Cuba. He had two sisters: the older was Josephine and the younger Angela. His father came from a family of 18 brothers and sisters. The family history has its roots in early sugar farming, from the early 1800s.\\r\\nAt an early age the family moved to the city of Cienfuegos and Carbonell went to study at \"Monserrat\" a primary school in the city. This proved to be the beginning of many lasting friendships.  Since his early childhood he was recognized for his interest in drawings and carvings.  Continuing on to his more formative academic years, in Havana he attended El Colegio de Belen, a Jesuit preparatory school, where he excelled in the classes involving art and history.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreativity\\r\\nCarbonell first realized he wanted to be a sculptor when he was eight or nine years old.  He was always making little figures with clay and whenever he found a piece of paper, he would doodle little figures on it.  His harshest punishment as a child was when his mother took away his pencils and paper.  Having the understanding that a piece of paper could be torn apart and disappear, ingrained in him that permanence could be achieved better by sculpting.  Depression would set in when he was not involved in the process of creation.  Quoting him, \"Something curious happens to me when I sit down to begin the process of translating the images in my imagination into this third dimension.  I see the whole piece finished, actually totally finished, in my minds eye, even before I begin.  But, as we all know, imagination can be very treacherous.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\nIn 1937, he wanted to learn about art and found out about \"San Alejandro\", the renowned Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Academy of Fine Arts) in Havana.  When he arrived, they asked him what previous training he had had.  Explaining, he told them he had none.  The school wanted him to go through a preliminary process for two years prior to attending, however he managed to prove himself with a clay carving that he had made that following weekend and they accepted him as a student on the spot.  Carbonell was 18 years old and barely beginning at San Alejandro when he fell down some stairs.  The injury was very severe; one of his kidneys had ruptured as a result of the impact.  He spent nearly one year partly paralyzed, unable to move easily.  He could not attend classes of course, the despair he felt, lying there, all that time was immeasurable.  But little by little he learned to walk again, he just stubbornly refused to give up, finally able to return to San Alejandro.  At the Academy, Carbonell studied under the guidance of Juan José Sicre, a former student of Antoine Bourdelle, Rodin\\'s favorite disciple. In 1945, at the age of 27, Carbonell graduated with the title of Professor of Drawing and Sculpture.  Carbonell met and worked alongside some great artists, Fidelio Ponce, Victor Manuel, Amelia Pelaez,Roberto Estopiñan and many others.  At San Alejandro, artistic excellence meant one must measure up to maximum standards or smash it into pieces and start again, that was the norm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginnings as a sculptor\\r\\nHis classical and religious period developed between 1945 and 1959 some of his many important commissions included the stone carvings as bas-reliefs of the Twelve Stations of the Cross, along with The Last Rites located at Las Lomas Del Jacan in San Miguel de los Baños, Matanzas province. Last Rites, was exhibited at the National Capitol in Havana. He also sculpted a statue of the Virgin Mary for the Association of Catholic University students in Havana. A life size wood carving of a crucifixion for the chapel at the Covadonga sugar mill in Las Villas, Cuba.\\r\\nCarbonell\\'s work received immediate recognition.  Dr. Roberto Lopez-Goldaras, the art critic of Havana\\'s Diario De La Marina, in Havana, said in 1951 about his work, \"We foresee for the young and distinguished sculptor Manuel Carbonell a great future; (he) who had been able to conceive a sculpture like \"Eternity\", will without a doubt, earn himself a glorious name, which is already a euphoric name, accredited among the literary and artistic names of Cuba.\"\\r\\nCarbonell participated in numerous national competitions and was the recipient of many awards. The life-size stone carving Fin de Una Raza (End of A Race) earned him his first international award in 1954, for the III Bienal Hispanoamericana de Arte, in Barcelona, Spain.  The sculpture became part of the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts in Havana; it appeared on the cover of Reader\\'s Digest magazine in May 1956.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessional journey\\r\\nFor the first commercial television broadcast, \"Union Radio Television\", Carbonell was the host and interviewer for a weekly television program where he interviewed artist as his topic of discussion, to include Wifredo Lam, among others. He worked in various aspects of television and production whereby he won an award in set design for the \"Union De La Cronica Tele-Radial Diaria\" in the second festival.\\r\\nBy 1954 Carbonell left for Europe visiting countless museums with the goal of experiencing for himself the opportunity to stand in front of great masterpieces to appreciate them and learn. He was able to explore countries such as Spain, Italy, France and England and understand their unique cultures. Europe proved to inspire Carbonell as he studied the art of the Impressionist and Abstract artists, which inspired a change in direction to give form a sense of movement.\\r\\nIn addition to his accomplishments as a sculptor, he owned an operated his own interior design business \"Carbonell Studio\". Here he designed from French to Modern furniture, incorporating his other beloved interest of creating an environment. He also had a high-end luxury boutique of decorative objects, which ultimately provided him with an ulterior motive of a purchasing trip, he was granted a visa to travel to the United States.  The perfect opportunity for defecting and leaving his homeland.\\r\\n\\r\\nExile to New York City\\r\\nIn 1959, Carbonell fled Cuba where he could no longer live under a totalitarian regime.  Leaving behind his wealth, his established positions, his sculptures, and most importantly his family. He arrived in New York City with only his tremendous talent and $200 in cash and initially took up residency at the YMCA.\\r\\nCarbonell moved away from his classical and religious period, in Cuba in the late 1940s and 1950s through the commencement and development of his modern expressions of the 1960s.\\r\\nAlthough at the beginning deeply depressed, this new trajectory first moved him to a unique form of figurative abstraction where the anatomy was subjected to the anatomical elongation of the subject matter.\\r\\nCarbonell\\'s new career in America started almost haphazardly and by chance.  As payment to his then public relations manager Ted Materna and Associates he provided one of his first sculptures in clay that he had created.  A very prominent doctor, Paul Henkind, then Chief of the Department of Ophthalmology at Monte Fiore Hospital, NYC, noticed the incredible sculpture and stated to Mr. Materna \"I didn\\'t know you owned a Rodin\"?  Which was actually a Carbonell. He insisted on meeting Carbonell to see his work and showed up unannounced at his studio in SoHo, that same evening with his wife they purchased their own Carbonell and became long lasting patrons.\\r\\nShortly after in 1961, Manuel Carbonell was introduced to Dr. Fred Schoneman, the influential and renowned gallery owner, who was impressed with what he saw of Carbonell\\'s work, and invited him to become the gallery\\'s first and only sculptor and he is quoted saying: \"He is indeed, as the critics have acclaimed and posterity will confirm, one of the Masters of Sculpture of our times.\"  The gallery exhibited Carbonell\\'s sculptures alongside European Masters and French Impressionist paintings of the 19th and 20th centuries, such as Braque, Chagall, Monet, Degas, Pissarro, Picasso, Gauguin, Renoir and others. Professional artistic success came with his new figuration sculptures when in 1963, he celebrated the first of his several \"One Man Show\" at the renowned Schoneman Gallery, Madison Avenue, in New York City, and collaborated in One Man Shows with other galleries, exceeding ten years, until Dr. Schonemans\\' passing.\\r\\nFor his first exhibition at Schoneman Galleries, Carbonell departed from clay and plaster forms and worked in hammered metals.  During this time, one sensed the influence of Pablo Gargallos\\' figurative abstract modern sculptures.  In 1967 he extended his frontier to include another one-man show in San Francisco at the Maxwell Galleries.  By 1971, Carbonell held two exhibitions, one again at Schoneman and the other at the Bacardi Galleries in Miami, Florida.  At this time, Carbonell moved from his previously acclaimed hammered metals and bronze finishes to high-polished bronzes sculptures. This new work took on a completely different aesthetic, becoming more abstract.  Rounded volumes replaced the elongated anatomical shapes, present in \"Lovers\", \"Madonna of the Moon\" and \"Figurative Form\".  During an exhibition at Galerie Moos, in 1972, in Montreal, Canada, the artist unveiled new subject matters through his high-polish bronze sculptures of \"Sea Horses, a Sea Lion, Snail and Mermaid\".\\r\\nRenamed as Randall Galleries, a former employee of Schoneman Galleries took control over the gallery in 1973, while Carbonell was preparing an exhibition that would pay tribute to dance.  The dancer series was a means to show his appreciation of dance as an art form, embracing the two art forms. The delicate lines of the ballet dancers are executed from a single point of balance. The graceful forms portray the excitement of their movement and beauty which is captured in reflective golden bronze. The opportunity to amplify this series turned into a benefit for The City Center in New York City to have an exhibition titled Homage to Ballet in 1974.\\r\\n\\r\\nReuniting with family\\r\\nIn 1960, Carbonell took in his two nephews, Ricardo aged 15 and Luis aged 13, to live with him in New Jersey to save them from being inducted into Castro\\'s military army. Soon enough, nine months later his father Manuel and his sisters Angela and Josefina with her two-year-old daughter, Clara, were able to leave Cuba and come to Miami.  After so many years living apart Carbonell was anxious to rejoin his family, he moved his studio to Miami in 1976.  Keeping a much lower profile he continued creating and selling his sculptures and concentrated on important private commissions. During 1977 Carbonell was given the challenge to construct the \"Virgin of Fatima\", for the Blue Army Shrine, in Washington, New Jersey. The 26-foot, 12,000 pound bronze sculpture was placed on top of a 150-foot shrine, considered one of the largest sculptures cast in America in the 20th century. His first commissioned bronze monument in the United States: A special and personal monumental sculpture during this same time was a composition of a 10-foot in height horse and rider, balanced on two points, which was commissioned by Burt Reynolds of himself for the entrance of the Burt Reynolds Jupiter Theatre, Jupiter, Florida.    The two men had a very fond and enduring friendship.\\r\\nThe awards formally presented by The South Florida Entertainment Writers Associations (SFEWA), an organization of major media theater critics from Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, on November 15, 1976, they selected Carbonell as the namesake. He was the creator of the award and The Estate of Manuel Carbonell continues to be the major benefactor of the \"Carbonell Awards\". They represent the highest achievement awards that annually recognizes and honors excellence in South Florida theater.  The organization considered this tribute to Carbonell, as he signified and represented one who devotes his life to art.\\r\\nIn 1976, Carbonell held a monographic exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum and Art Center, in Miami, Florida, on view at the opening of their newest gallery, where he introduced more than 20 of his latest works. (Now incorporated into, The Frost Art Museum). Between the late 1070s and mid-1080s, the artist worked on private commissions and ventured creatively in designing jewelry and furniture. At that time, he had several one-man shows that were also presented at different galleries during this decade, including Steiner Gallery in Bal Harbor, West Avenue Gallery in Palm Beach, Camino Real in Boca Raton, all in Florida and the Ann Jacob Gallery, in Marietta, Georgia.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe White House\\r\\nIn 1976 Carbonell created the \"Bicentennial Eagle\", which he gifted to the United States of America, during a ceremony on the West Lawn of the White House in honor of the nation\\'s Bicentennial Anniversary. During the bicentennial celebrations the sculpture was on display in the Great Hall of Commerce in Washington D.C.  This sculpture is now part of The Gerald R. Ford, Presidential Library, Ann Arbor, Michigan, which is technically a branch office of The National Archives and Records Administration Collection, that the Federal government oversees.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeaux Arts Gallery\\r\\nA formal representation begun in 1987 as Beaux Arts Gallery, Miami Florida, became the exclusive worldwide representative of Carbonell\\'s work, under the Owner/Director, Ricardo J. Gonzalez III, an architect and Carbonell\\'s nephew.\\r\\nDuring the following years, his endless creative imagination took him to follow in the steps of European Masters such as Moore, Brancusi, and Arp and other artist of the figurative abstract movement.  In Carbonells\\' sculptures you can experience the monumentality of the works of Henry Moore, and the simplicity found in the works of Brancusi, Archipenko and Arp, but in his oeuvre, he sought a different form of figuration, where he searched for the essence of the form and the absence of details while empowering a feeling of monumentality to his sculptures.  At this time Carbonell moved from his high polished bronzes to dark patinas.  His figurative abstract sculptures created an impression or illusion of form and space, which are representational and based on the anatomical simplification of the form from a variety of sources.  His distinctive personal style is easily identifiable and recognized by the consistency in the originality of his works, the uniqueness of his interpretations and the sense of universal appeal that he imparted to his sculptures.\\r\\nThe years between 1987 and 1988 marked a very creative and productive period for Carbonell.  Lovers, mother and child, dancers and the female figure intensified as subject matter in his artistic vision. He redefined forms and contours, while maintaining the anatomical essence of the human figure, bringing female sensuality to a point of abstraction, while displaying a sense of aesthetic basic principles in a simplified form.  A continuance of one-man shows and exhibits along with art fairs nationally and internationally have since to date been part of this relationship.\\r\\nHaving won a competition in 1989 to create a statue of the Cuban Apostle Jose Martí for the San Carlos Institute in Key West, Florida. Carbonell returned for this commission to his classical period to create the statue.\\r\\nA subject very close to Carbonell\\'s heart: the artist struggled with the challenge of translating the human Martí into the idealized and heroic universal figure that Martí\\'s philosophy and spirituality represented. Conquering this challenge, in 1990 Carbonell moved to Pietrasanta, (Holy Stone) Italy to carve a 6-foot marble sculpture that portrays Martí with his left arm extended, as if to greet visitors, while the right hand rest on a bundle of wheat surrounded by the Cuban flag.  The symbolism conveyed by the statue is that a cause, like one stalk of wheat, may become weak, but becomes strong when its supporters band together.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Miami River Bridge\\r\\nCarbonell was selected in a competition in 1992, this was to create one of the largest bronze monuments in the State of Florida, the artwork for Miami\\'s Brickell Avenue Bridge, Miami Florida. Carbonell created the 53-foot bronze public monument \"The Pillar of History and the Tequesta Family\", located mid-span on the bridge. The pillar illustrates a carved graphical narration of the lives of the Tequesta Indians, Miami\\'s first inhabitants, featuring 150 figures.  At the top stands a 17-foot bronze sculpture, \"Tequesta Family\" portraying a Tequesta Indian warrior aiming an arrow to the sky with his wife and child at his side.  In the niches at the supporting piers are four 4-foot by 8-foot bronze bas reliefs honoring the quintessential Miami pioneers Henry Flagler, Dana A. Dorsey, William and Mary Brickell, Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Julia Tuttle, depicting them in their historical perpetual settings.  Twelve bronze bas-reliefs of Florida fauna are located at the base of the flagpoles on the walk ways of both sides of the bridge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Little Miracles\", certainly an invaluable opportunity, I was in love with the project, first because the Tequesta\\'s are a fascinating people, secondly, because it was an important monument, with such tremendous dimensions.  I am convinced that, previously, long ago, there were many civilizations more advanced than ours, who knew how to enjoy the beauty of the soul.  While I was in Pietrasanta, Italy to commence this two-year project, having finished all the bas-reliefs and having completed carving 3/5 of the pillar, I suffered a stroke. My left side was paralyzed, and being left-handed I was desperate. I kept asking the medical staff, \"listen, when can I once again begin to move my arm, I am a sculptor\", the reply \"be patient\" which I am not.  On the one hand, I would tell myself, \"look Carbonell, you are no longer a sculptor, you have been a sculptor for more than seventy years, but you are no longer a sculptor now\".  \"Your left hand is paralyzed\".  \"Nobody can change that\".  It\\'s absurd but on the other hand, since I couldn\\'t accept that, I would say, \"yes, I can, I can change that\".  The doctors released me from the hospital so I could emotionally feel better and come back in a couple of months to start my physical therapy.  Ten days later, I told my assistants to bring the unfinished portion and get me my tools, and bring them to the house because I wanted to start carving again.  Shortly thereafter, my therapy nurse that came to my house spread the news I was astonishing.  All my friends from the hospital arrived, they couldn\\'t believe that I was already working, ok, maybe not with my left hand, but I was surely working with my right hand.  \"My life is my work.  And my work is my life.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nOther monuments to follow\\r\\nBetween 1996 and 1999, Carbonell remained in Pietrasanta working on two commissions for monumental sculptures: \"El Centinela del Rio\", a 21-foot bronze sculpture depicting a Tequesta Indian blowing into a bronze and alabaster conch shell.  The sculpture is located at Tequesta Point on Brickell Key.  Serving as a welcoming site to all and luminous at night, at the entrance of the  Miami River.  Another is \"The Manatee Fountain\", consisting of three Indian children playing with two manatees, located at the walkway between, Two and Three Tequesta Point condominiums on Brickell Key, Miami, Florida.  Swire Properties and Manuel Carbonell had a unique patronage, not only is there \"The Swire Art Trust\", there was the \"Swire Carbonell Scholarship Fund\" for the Florida International University Foundation.\\r\\nHis modern monumental works, created in his unique and distinctive personal style, are part of important art collections and public spaces,  \"Couple in Love\" adorns the lobby of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Miami, \"Lovers\" is located at the entrance of the Carbonell Condominium, named in the artist honor, \"Torso\" formally at Selby\\'s Five Point Park, downtown Sarasota then at the von Liebig Art Center in Naples, Florida.  \"New Generation\" is in Xujianhui Park, Shanghai, China.  The sculpture of \" Amantes\" now graces the grounds of The Buenaventura Golf and Beach Resort Panama, under the Autograph Collection of J.W. Marriott, Republic of Panama. \"Abrazo\" and \"Couple in Love\" enhance the first Ritz Carlton Hotel, in Bangalore, India.  \"Mother and Child\" together with \"Amantes\" are amongst the garden of Château de Vullierens, Vullierens, Switzerland, and \"Birth of Eve\" at the entrance rotunda of Brickell Key Two Condominium, Miami, Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater life\\r\\nManuel Carbonell died at Kindred Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida, on November 10, 2011, at the age of 93. He was survived by his two sisters, Josefina Gonzalez and Angela Carbonell; niece, Clara Falcon; and nephews, Ricardo and Luis Gonzalez. His funeral mass was held at the chapel of Belen Jesuit Preparatory School in Miami.  The sentiment of having the service take place at Belen was because Carbonell created and contributed to most everything in the chapel.\\r\\n\\r\\nGallery\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\n1945: Carbonell graduates from the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes \"San Alejandro\" with the title of Professor of Drawing and Sculpture.\\r\\n1948: Competition for Pieta and Twelve Stations of the Cross, San Miguel de los Banos, Cuba.\\r\\n1949: Exposicion del Museo Nacional de Cuba, National Show, Havana.\\r\\n1954: Bienal Hispanoamericana de Arte, International Show, Barcelona.\\r\\n1954: Exposicion Del Museo de Bellas Artes, National Show, Havana.\\r\\n1959: Carbonell goes into exile in New York.\\r\\n1963: Schoneman Galleries, 63 East 57th Street New York, begins to represent Carbonell, First One Man Show at Schoneman Galleries.\\r\\n1965: Schoneman Galleries, 63 East 57th Street.

In the next year, he accepted an invitation to teach drawing and sculpture in Santa Fé. There, Marsal participated in urban planning, sculpture production and became part of the city artistic and cultural life. One of his sculptures, a bust of the educator called Sarmento, remains in the plaza dedicated to the teacher. In 1901, he became Art Director of the \"Blanco & Negro\" magazine. In 1907, at the age of 46 and highly recognized in the artistic field, Marsal moved to Asunción in Paraguay according to medical recommendations, due to the health problems experienced by his wife. In this smaller city, he faced economic difficulties, as orders were rarer. He taught on the Arts School. Even with no orders, Marsal started to produce small clay statues that represented the Paraguayan people with perfection.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtworks\\r\\nMade by hand with clay from Picolmayo River, each statuette represented a typical figure of the Paraguayan people with a variety of details and beautiful finishing. Marsal made each figure a mold from which he extracted the essential piece. However, his method was not a multiple-piece system, so the finishing of each piece was made by hand, and one was different from the other. Besides beauty and a careful finishing, his pieces have an important historical value, as they portray typical figures of a period. They are social representations: There is a woman carrying a jar over her head, donkey as a means of transportation, Indian faces, a man that sold fruits, among many others that frequented the Asunción market. In addition, all figures were entitled in Guaraní, the people language. In autobiographical notes, Marsal once wrote:\\r\\n\"For approximately 18 years I dedicate myself to making little figures in clay. I calculate that perhaps one hundred small figures were created monthly in my house to be sold in North America, fifty thousand to be sold in Central America and South America; in Europe, four or five thousand; in Japan a bit more one thousand, and many others whose destination I ignore\".\\r\\nTo date, what remained from his works, as the used material is quite fragile, belongs to private collections and to the Museo Memoria de la Ciudad, which has a collection of 36 pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nGuarani Portal\\r\\nMuseo Memoria de la Ciudad\\r\\n\\r\\nMagazine ABC Article about Marsal', 'Carlos Eduardo Lozada (born 1971) is a Peruvian-American journalist and author.

After resigning from the government, he became an opposition leader, founding the Gabonese Union for Democracy and Development (UGDD) in 2005 and placing third in the 2005 presidential election. He became President of the Group of the Forces of Change in the National Assembly in 2007.\\r\\nIn February 2010, the UGDD merged with two other opposition parties to create the National Union, and Myboto became its President.\\r\\nIn November 2021, Paulette Missambo, former Minister of National Education and Health under former President Omar Bongo Ondimba, was elected President of the National Union. the 654 delegates came from all over Gabon to choose Zacharie Myboto successor.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical career in the PDG\\r\\nMyboto was born at Omo�, Moanda, located in southeastern Gabon, in 1938. He became a member of the PDG when it was founded in 1968, and he was Director of the Cabinet of the Minister of Water and Forests from September 1968 to May 1971. He joined the PDG Political Bureau at the party\\'s Constitutive Congress in September 1970. After working as Secretary-General of the Gabonese Marble Company (Soci�t� Gabonaise de Marbrerie, SOGAMAR) from May 1971 to November 1972, he became the PDG\\'s Administrative Secretary in November 1972.\\r\\nLater, Myboto was Secretary of State at the Presidency in charge of Information from 4 February 1978 to 26 February 1980 and Minister Delegate at the Presidency in charge of Information, Posts and Telecommunications from February 1980 to 1981. He was then promoted to the position of Minister of Information, Posts and Telecommunications in 1981, and he held that post until February 1990, when he was instead appointed as Minister of Public Works, Equipment, Construction, and Urban and Regional Planning. After 17 years as the PDG\\'s Administrative Secretary, he left that post in January 1990. In the September 1990 parliamentary election, he was elected to the National Assembly as a PDG candidate from the second seat of Lemboumbi-Leyou Department (Mounana), located in Haut Ogoou� Province.\\r\\nIn June 1991, Myboto was moved to the position of Minister of Equipment and Construction; he was promoted to the rank of Minister of State for Equipment and Construction on 25 March 1994.

He then took up his seat in the National Assembly on 1 March 2001. In the December 2001 parliamentary election, he was re-elected to the National Assembly from Mounana.\\r\\nAfter leaving the government, Myboto became a critic of the government. He owned L\\'Autre Journal, a newspaper that was published bimonthly and included articles criticizing the government, but it was suspended by the National Communications Council in December 2003 on the grounds that some of its content could \"disturb public order\". The offices of L\\'Autre Journal were searched by the police in March 2004.\\r\\nHaving departed the government four years earlier, Myboto resigned from the PDG on 30 April 2005 and created a new party, the UGDD; as a result, he also resigned from the National Assembly at the same time. Referring to his long history of participation in the PDG regime, he asked the people to forgive his past mistakes. Myboto and members of his family were reportedly subjected to harassment after he left the party, and some of his relatives reportedly lost their government jobs.\\r\\nOn 9 October 2005, Myboto officially announced his candidacy for the 27 November 2005 presidential election before a crowd of over 5,000 supporters. Fiercely critical of Bongo and the government, Myboto alleged that Bongo had won the December 1998 presidential election through fraud. Running as an independent candidate (because the UGDD was not legalized prior to the election), he placed third out of five candidates, winning 6.58% of the vote. Following Bongo\\'s victory, Myboto and second place candidate Pierre Mamboundou called for a general strike in early December, alleging fraud. Later in the month, they legally appealed against the results, asking that they be cancelled due to fraud. The Constitutional Court rejected the appeals on 5 January 2006, confirming Bongo\\'s victory.\\r\\nAs a representative of the opposition, Myboto was included on the joint majority�opposition commission on the reform of the electoral process, which began its work in May 2006 and included 12 representatives from the Presidential Majority as well as 12 from the opposition.

He said that he thought it was \"physically impossible\" to hold the election within the constitutional 45-day timeframe and spoke of instead holding an election in five to six months. Myboto announced on 20 July that he would stand as a candidate \"for a transition\" in the election, which was scheduled for 30 August 2009, and that he intended to serve only one term if elected.\\r\\nIn an interview with Radio France Internationale on 24 August 2009, Myboto reiterated his \"solemn commitment\" to serving only one term of seven years if he won the election; he said that he would use that time to \"put Gabon on track\" and then \"pass the baton\" to a \"properly elected and credible\" successor. Pointing to his resignation from the government in 2001 (which he said was \"not easy\" to do), he stressed that in order to discourage the tendency of politicians to try to remain in office \"forever\", it was necessary to lead by example. Myboto also said that he would reform the constitution to restore the presidential two-term limit and \"end the life presidency in Gabon\". In the same interview, Myboto expressed grave doubts about the fairness of the election, saying that the electoral list was seriously inflated and fraudulent; nevertheless, he said it was still worthwhile to participate in the election so as to do \"everything possible\" to prevent \"monarchy\" (in reference to the PDG\\'s nomination of Bongo\\'s son Ali-Ben Bongo as its candidate). When asked what distinguished him from other opposition candidates, Myboto said that, by resigning from the government in 2001, he demonstrated that he \"had the courage to say no to the late President Bongo\"; he also stressed that he had acquired \"long experience in people management and the management of public affairs\" through his work as a minister in the government.\\r\\nAccording to official results, Myboto placed fourth in the 2009 election with 3.94% of the vote, far behind the top three candidates; Ali Bongo won the election with 42% of the vote. Along with every other candidate (except Bongo), he signed a joint statement denouncing the results as fraudulent. Like the second and third place candidates, Andr� Mba Obame and Mamboundou, he initially went into hiding amidst the violence that followed the announcement of results, although he soon emerged to attend an opposition meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nNational Union\\r\\nOn 30 December 2009, the planned creation of a new, united opposition party was announced, and Myboto was among the various opposition leaders participating in it. Myboto then announced the creation of the new party, known as the National Union (Union nationale, UN), on 10 February 2010; the UN was created through the merger of the UGDD with two smaller parties, the African Development Movement (MAD) and the National Republican Rally (RNR). Also included in the new party were three major politicians who ran as independent candidates in the 2009 presidential election: Mba Obame, Casimir Oy�-Mba, and Jean Eyegh� Ndong. When announcing the UN\\'s creation, Myboto described it as \"a historic moment\", saying that \"for the first time in our country, opposition parties have decided to come together for political change\".\\r\\nIn the midst of the violence that followed the announcement of Ali Bongo\\'s re-election in August 2016, Myboto was one of the opposition leaders briefly detained at the campaign headquarters of opposition candidate Jean Ping.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Scott Robinson is a fictional character from the Australian television soap opera Neighbours. He was created by Reg Watson as one of the serial\\'s twelve original characters. Originally played by Darius Perkins, he made his debut during the first episode broadcast on 18 March 1985. Perkins was 20 years old when he received the role of teenager Scott. He felt some anxiety about his audition performance and did not think anything was going to come from it, until the production company contacted him a month later to sign on as Scott. When production moved to Network Ten in 1986, producers wanted \"a more upfront\" Scott and the role was recast to Jason Donovan, who joined the cast following his graduation from school. He made his debut on 12 February 1986, and producers hoped Donovan\\'s blond hair and blue eyes would increase the character\\'s appeal. Perkins later said that he had been physically and mentally exhausted after filming for nine months, and felt unable to continue in the role of Scott.\\r\\nAt the beginning of Neighbours, Scott is a 16 year old high school student, living at home with his father, grandmother, and three siblings. Scott is shown to be close with his father, whom he respects. He is initially characterised as a normal, happy teenager, with an increasing interest in girls as he becomes an adolescent. His best friend was neighbour Danny Ramsay (David Clencie), a role Donovan originally auditioned for. Scott\\'s early storylines include a romance with fellow student Kim Taylor (Jenny Young) and being accused of robbery. With Donovan in the role, Scott was portrayed as charming, perceptive, neat, and likeable, leading him to become the show\\'s male pin up. Donovan\\'s popularity set a new standard for casting directors, which they felt they had to meet every time they introduced a new \"stud\" character. Producers soon created a story arc around Scott\\'s relationship with Charlene Mitchell, played by Kylie Minogue. \\r\\nScott and Charlene\\'s romance led to increased ratings for Neighbours and the show\\'s publicist capitalised on Minogue and Donovan\\'s popularity with viewers. Scott and Charlene experience a variety of problems during their first 12 months together. When Scott suggests they should move in together, this caused controversy on and off-screen, with some Neighbours viewers expressing their concern about a young unwed couple moving in together. Producers then decided that the couple would marry instead and their wedding was broadcast on 1 July 1987 to two million Australian viewers. To keep the relationship interesting, writers scripted a kiss between Scott and Jane Harris (Annie Jones). On 7 March 1989, it was announced that Donovan had quit Neighbours to pursue a music career, and his exit aired on 18 May 1989. For his portrayal of Scott, Donovan won the Logie Award for Most Popular New Talent (1987) and Most Popular Actor (1988). He was twice nominated for the Gold Logie for Most Popular Personality. In 2022, Donovan agreed to reprise his role, alongside Minogue, for what was believed (at the time) to be the show\\'s final ever episode. Subsequently, Amazon announced that they had picked up the series for their Freevee streaming service, and Amazon started filming the revived series in April 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreation and casting\\r\\nScott is one of the twelve original characters conceived by the creator and then executive producer of Neighbours, Reg Watson. Darius Perkins was 20 years old when he received the role of teenager Scott. When Perkins learned the telemovie Matthew and Son, in which he starred alongside Paul Cronin, was not going to be picked up to series, he knew he was free to join the cast of Neighbours. He told Patrice Fidgeon of TV Week that he had already heard about Neighbours before any decision had been made about Matthew and Son, but he had not decided on what he wanted to do that year, admitting that he \"didn\\'t want to lock myself into a situation I couldn\\'t get out of.\" Perkins admitted to feeling anxious about his performance following his audition for Scott. He told Fidgeon: \"I didn\\'t have the faintest idea about the character I was supposed to be playing.\" The serial\\'s producers deliberately kept the character outlines vague, except for the character\\'s age, gender, and hair colour. Perkins reckoned this was to prevent character information escaping before they were ready to start filming. It was around a month before Perkins heard back about his audition and he came to believe nothing was going to happen. The Grundy Organisation later got in contact to ask him to sign on to play Scott. Perkins told Fidgeon that he had a six-month contract with a six-month option on their side, but that was as far as he wanted to commit to the show. He stated \"I prefer not to be tied at all, but that\\'s the way it goes. They have to have their security.\" His casting was publicised in the 26 January 1985 issue of TV Week. Perkins made his debut as Scott in the show\\'s pilot episode broadcast on 18 March 1985.\\r\\nAfter concerns over Perkins\\' reliability and a series of rows, producers decided to recast the role of Scott when production moved to Network Ten. Jason Donovan, then 17, was given the role following his graduation from school. Donovan was originally asked to audition for the role of Danny Ramsay while Neighbours was in the planning stages, but his father, actor Terence Donovan, advised him against it and told him to finish school first. He initially did not want his son to become an actor as he felt the industry was too \"unstable.\" Donovan admitted that had never watched Neighbours before joining the cast, saying \"I\\'d sort of flicked through it once, but that was all.\" He made his debut as Scott on 12 February 1986. Scott soon became the serial\\'s new \"pin-up\" character and Donovan\\'s image and popularity in the role set a high standard for casting directors, which they felt they had to meet each time they were introducing a \"stud\" type character.\\r\\nIn an October 1988 interview with TV Week\\'s Leigh Reinhold, Perkins addressed the rumours that he was fired from Neighbours for a drug problem, calling them \"invented stories\". He told Reinhold that he had refused to continue with the show when it moved to Network Ten in 1986. Having been working for nine months, Perkins was both physically and mentally exhausted, and felt unable to continue in the role of Scott. Perkins stated \"Drugs had nothing to do with me leaving. It was a personal decision. I was feeling trapped at the time. Towards the end I didn\\'t think I was giving enough of myself. I didn\\'t want to end up not wanting to watch myself on screen.\" He had also blamed a failed relationship for being unable to handle the pressure, which he said was \"a bit of a cop-out.\" Perkins was shocked by some of the press stories written about a supposed drug dependency, and said that when he attended casting sessions, he thought people were probably wondering whether he was \"\\'out of it\\' or not.\" Perkins admitted that he was glad not to be with Neighbours, despite its success at the time, or in Donovan\\'s shoes. He wished Donovan well, but he did not want to be him, adding that he wanted to build his acting career slowly to gain respect.\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment\\r\\nCharacterisation and early storylines\\r\\nAs the serial begins, Scott is a 16 year old high school student, living at home with his widowed father Jim Robinson (Alan Dale), his grandmother Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy), and three siblings Paul (Stefan Dennis), Julie (Vikki Blanche), and Lucy (Kylie Flinker; Sasha Close). Scott was shown to be close with his father, but had a strained relationship with his older brother Paul. His best friend was neighbour Danny Ramsay (David Clencie). Scott was billed as \"a normal, usually happy 16-year-old\". An Inside Soap writer called him \"a dark-haired, geeky schoolboy\". Margaret Koppe of TV Radio Extra said Scott was moving into the adolescent stage and gaining an interest in girls. He eventually fell \"hopelessly in love\" with Kim Taylor (Jenny Young). In her book, Soap Box, Hilary Kingsley wrote that Scott was not \"such a goodie\" while played by Perkins. One of the character\\'s early storylines saw him and Danny get into trouble with the police over a suspected robbery, and they flee Erinsborough to work on a farm. They later fight over Wendy Gibson (Kylie Foster). As Neighbours moved to Network Ten, producers wanted \"a more upfront\" Scott. To facilitate the recast from Perkins to Donovan, Scott goes missing on a school trip and is briefly presumed dead, before he reappears played by Donovan. Producers hoped the actor\\'s blond hair and blue eyes would increase the character\\'s \"bankable appeal\".\\r\\nAfter Donovan took over the role, Kingsley branded Scott \"the star schoolboy of Neighbours and described him as \"polite, perceptive, neat and nice.\" She thought it was likely he folded his own clothes too, making him stand out among the teenagers of the time. Although Scott was involved in \"the occasional teenage hiccup\" he was both \"likeable\" and \"hard working\". Donovan shared some similarities to Scott, including being raised by a single parent. Donovan stated \"I\\'ve done most of the things Scott\\'s done – school exams and things like that – so I don\\'t really have to go too far to understand his character.\" The actor admitted to not being happy with Scott\\'s attitude, calling him \"very moody and a bit hard to play sometimes\". He tried to bring as much comedy and lightness to the role that he could, as he believed Neighbours should have light characters and not \"always heavy drama.\" The character soon became the show\\'s male \"pin up\". Writer Josephine Monroe observed that Donovan turned Scott into \"every girl\\'s dream date\". He was perceived as being cute, as well as \"witty and charming\". He continued to be close to his father, whom he respected and looked up to, while he was also protective of younger sister Lucy. After leaving school, the character\\'s ambition was to become a journalist.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelationship with Charlene Mitchell\\r\\nIn April 1986, Kylie Minogue joined the cast as Charlene Mitchell, daughter of Scott\\'s neighbour Madge Mitchell (Anne Charleston). Her first scene was with Scott, who thinks she is trying to break into Madge\\'s house. When he goes to stop her, Charlene punches him in the mouth. Minogue ended up punching Donovan for real during filming. The actors had previously worked together in an episode of Skyways when they were younger. Donovan later recalled that he encountered Minogue for the first time on-set in the wardrobe bus. She reminded him of their work on Skyways after he failed to recognise her. He stated that they soon become good friends as their characters became acquainted. Producers soon created a story arc for the characters that saw them enter into a romantic relationship. Scott and Charlene\\'s romance contributed to a boost in ratings for Neighbours and the show\\'s publicist, Brian Walsh, capitalised on Minogue and Donovan\\'s increasing popularity with viewers and rumoured off-screen romance. Donovan felt that his on-screen rapport with Minogue was due to their professionalism. He stated \"When you\\'ve known someone for a long time and you get on with them well, then it\\'s quite easy to create a professional chemistry. That\\'s what you see between us in Neighbours.\" Minogue believed the couple\\'s relationship helped the characters to become fan favourites, saying \"In the storyline they break up and get back together. People like Scott and Charlene being a couple. It\\'s probably the most normal relationship in the show.\" Donovan admitted that he would not want to date someone like Charlene, as he thought she was \"far too stroppy\" for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nKelly Bourne from TV Week said Scott and Charlene resonated with the show\\'s fans, as many could identify with them. Viewers saw the couple experience a variety of problems during their first 12 months together and \"matters come to a head\" after Madge pressures Charlene to date other boys, while Scott has to repeat his final year of school without her. Donovan explained to Bourne that Scott realises he does not want to lose Charlene, and so he seeks advice from his grandmother, who mentions that her husband gave her a friendship ring. Donovan said \"Scott thinks about it and decides this would be a good way to show Charlene how he feels.\" Charlene is \"flattered\" by the ring, and Donovan said that it finally settles the point that they are not going to break-up again and that they love one another. Minogue agreed, saying \"There is that underlying love whether they are together or not.\" Shortly after Scott presents Charlene with the ring at her new caravan, they start a barbecue dinner to celebrate, however, they soon begin arguing when Scott make it clear he is not happy about Charlene spending time with Warren Murphy (Ben Mendelsohn).\\r\\nScott \"storms away\", but when he hears Charlene calling out to him, he sees that she is trapped by a ring of petrol headed towards the barbecue. Unbeknownst to Charlene, arsonist Greg Davis (Alex Papps) was storing fuel under her caravan and he spilled it as he was removing the cans. Donovan told TV Week\\'s Stephen Cook: \"When Scott first sees the petrol and then the flames he just does what his instincts tell him to do. He can see see what\\'s going to happen next and he knows he has got to get Charlene out of there.\" Donovan continued by saying that Scott does not think about the danger to himself, he just goes through the flames and gets her out. The pair are thrown to the ground after an explosion and Scott holds onto a badly injured Charlene. Donovan told Cook that Scott is not sure whether Charlene is dead or alive. Although he has been burnt himself, he knows something is wrong with her and he is \"devastated\". Scott realises how deep his love for Charlene is and suggests that the couple move in together. This causes \"a major controversy\" and divides the Ramsay Street residents. \\r\\nDaphne Clarke (Elaine Smith) is taken aback by how serious the couple have become, but wishes them well, while Donovan explained that Scott\\'s friend Mike Young (Guy Pearce) is \"a lot more moralistic about just what the two are getting themselves into.\" When some Neighbours viewers expressed their concern about a young unwed couple moving in together, the producers decided to have the couple marry instead. On-screen, neither family approve of Scott and Charlene moving in together, so when Scott learns his father married at 18, he decides that he and Charlene will marry instead. Charlene is surprised by the proposal, but Minogue said she soon becomes \"very excited\" about the idea of getting married. Jim is against the idea of the couple marrying, believing they are too young (Scott was said to be 18 at the time, and Charlene was 17), while Madge wishes them the best. Donovan told Bourne that in real life he preferred the idea of younger couples living together first, adding that his character was immature and rushing into marriage. Scott and Charlene\\'s wedding was broadcast on 1 July 1987 to two million Australian viewers. After returning from their honeymoon, Scott and Charlene move in with Madge and her brother Henry Ramsay (Craig McLachlan), and they struggle financially. \\r\\nJust three months after their wedding, producers decided to throw temptation at the couple to keep their relationship interesting. While studying for his HSC, Scott asks Jane Harris (Annie Jones) to help him with his maths. Donovan said Scott is grateful to Jane and the pair become really close friends. During a study session, they go to the lake to work without interruptions and they end up kissing. When Charlene finds out, the repercussions almost end Scott and Charlene\\'s marriage. Donovan admitted to some concerns about the storyline when he learned about it from the producers. He explained to TV Week\\'s Patrice Fidgeon: \"I was worried people would think Scott was a heel. But it was really quite innocent. He doesn\\'t know why he kissed Jane – it sort of just happened.\" Donovan said the kiss between Scott and Jane happens on \"the spur of moment\" and he does not tell Charlene about it, but when she learns they were at the lake together, she confronts him. Donovan told Fidgeon that Scott \"blurts out\" that it was just a kiss, as he thinks Charlene is reading too much into it. The resulting argument between the couple ends in Scott walking out and moving back home with the Robinsons, where he goes through \"a bout of depression.\" Jane helps reunite the couple when she tells Charlene that if she does not want Scott, either she or some other girl would have him. This makes Charlene realise what she has in Scott and they reconcile.\\r\\nFollowing Charlene\\'s move to Brisbane, where the couple have a new house courtesy of Charlene\\'s grandfather, Scott remains behind for work. In a further bid to test the couple\\'s marriage, producers introduced Sylvie Latham (Christine Harris) and Poppy Skouros (Lenita Vangellis). With Charlene having just left Erinsborough, Scott is feeling lonely without her. He agrees to interview Jane\\'s friend and fellow model Sylvie for the Erinsborough News. Harris said that from the moment Sylvie meets Scott, she wants him and sets out to seduce him. Harris commented \"She goes for what she wants at the expense of other people.\" Harris also branded the plot \"Fatal Attraction comes to Neighbours\". Harris did not receive any hate mail from fans of Scott and Charlene, and put it down to her empathetic portrayal of Sylvie. Scott\\'s second love interest was fellow news cadet Poppy, who teams up with Scott to write an article about migrants. Vangellis told Coral O\\'Connor of the Daily Mirror that the pair spend a lot of time together and Poppy falls in love with Scott, but \"his is a much slower process.\" Their closeness does not go unnoticed, and while the residents of Ramsay Street like Poppy, their loyalties are with Scott and Charlene. Vangellis disliked the way Poppy declared her love to Scott, but she did not think she was a femme fatale, but rather \"an unfortunate little girl who makes the wrong moves.\" Fans did not like the storyline and Vangellis revealed that she was once chased onto a tram by a group of school girls calling her a \"homewrecker.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDeparture and return\\r\\nIn May 1988, David Brown of TV Week reported Minogue had quit Neighbours in order to pursue a music career and was due to film her final scenes in June. After months of speculation that Donovan would also leave the soap, he signed a new contract and said the show was still important to him. He told Brown: \"I\\'m happy doing the show because I want to keep learning. I\\'ve got this real bug about Neighbours at the moment and it\\'s something I just want to keep doing and get better at. I don\\'t think I\\'d be doing myself justice if I took the big plunge to get out to try and do other things. I\\'m still learning and there are good storylines coming up that I can tackle.\" Brown reported that many people believed Donovan would leave the show to work in London because of the success of the show in the UK. Donovan said that he was happy working in Australia and admitted that he had not really thought about leaving the serial at the time. He continued: \"There was the speculation, but none of that was happening in my mind. The past couple of years has taken me by surprise, so I had a lot to think about. You don\\'t just rush out and sign a contract. So in those terms, yes I\\'ve taken my time. Network Ten and Grundys have been so good to me. They\\'ve been helping me and nurturing me, so why should I want to leave?\" Donovan also denied that he was \"jumping on the Kylie bandwagon\" by recording and releasing an album, saying that he always had an interest in music.\\r\\nOn-screen, Charlene moves to Brisbane and Scott promises to follow her, but only if he can secure a journalism job like the one has in Erinsborough. On 7 March 1989, it was announced that Donovan had quit Neighbours to pursue a music career. Coincidentally his record \"Too Many Broken Hearts\" reached Number One on the UK Singles Chart that same day. Donovan signed a new contract with Network Ten which allowed him to leave the show earlier than his original contract stipulated. Donovan said he was sad to be leaving Neighbours, but he felt it was time to move on. He stated, \"They have been great and afforded me many opportunities. My contract allows me to return to Neighbours, so I\\'m still going to leave my options open.\" Donovan denied that he was \"fed up\" of playing Scott, but he felt that he had \"fulfilled that part of me as far as acting is concerned.\" Network Ten\\'s publicity director, Brian Walsh, was confident that Neighbours would continue to be a success after Donovan\\'s departure and thanked him for his work promoting the show during his tenure. He added: \"Jason was one of the new talents fostered by Neighbours and the series will continue to develop others.\" Donovan filmed his final episode in April, and it aired on 18 May 1989. Scott leaves Erinsborough to join Charlene.\\r\\nIn 2009, Donovan revealed that he had been asked to return to the show for the 25th anniversary celebrations. He could not return due to work commitments, but he said that he was \"very proud\" of having been in Neighbours. Donovan was invited to return for the 30th anniversary celebrations in 2015, but he declined the offer, commenting \"it\\'s just not something I want to do.\" However, he agreed to take part in the documentary special Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite, which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015.\\r\\nIn March 2022, Fiona Byrne of the Herald Sun reported on 1 May that both Donovan and Minogue were set to reprise their roles. Byrne believed Donovan and Minogue had filmed a guest appearance on Pin Oak Court, the outdoor location for Ramsay Street, during the previous week. Later on the same day, the return of Donovan and Minogue was confirmed on Neighbours\\' social media accounts. Executive producer Jason Herbison stated: \"Scott and Charlene are the ultimate Neighbours couple and it would not feel right to end the show without them. We are thrilled that Jason and Kylie have come home to play a very special part in our series finale. It has been an emotional experience for them, for us and I\\'m sure it will be for our viewers.\" They appeared in was believed (at the time) to be the show\\'s final ever episode. Subsequently, Amazon announced that they had picked up the series for their Freevee streaming service, and Amazon started filming the revived series in April 2023.\\r\\n\\r\\nStorylines\\r\\nScott lives on Ramsay Street with his father Jim, grandmother Helen Daniels and his siblings Paul, Julie and Lucy. Scott\\'s mother, Anne died giving birth to Lucy. Scott becomes close friends with his neighbour Danny Ramsay. Scott falls for his classmate Kim Taylor but her mother, teacher Marcia (Maureen Edwards) disapproves. When Danny and Eddie Sherwin (Darren Boyd) doctor a recorded conversation between Scott and Kim to make sound more sexual than it really it is, Marcia forces Eddie to play the tape in class which humiliates Kim. Despite Scott protesting his innocence, The Taylors forbid him to see Kim and threaten to call the police. Scott and Kim then run away and hide out in an abandoned monastery. Scott returns home but Kim runs away. Scott later tracks down Kim who is pregnant and helps her reconcile with Marcia. Scott and Danny witness their neighbour Carol Brown (Merrin Canning) being mugged and try to go to her aid but she accuse them of attacking her, prompting the boys to flee and hide out on Mrs. Forbes\\' (Gwen Plumb) farm where they work for her, tending to her land. They eventually return home. Scott and Danny then squabble over Wendy Gibson (Kylie Foster) but eventually patch up their friendship.\\r\\nWhen Scott is late back from a school trip, Jim and Helen worry and further grief comes when the police find a body of a 16-year-old boy in the river, with Scott\\'s wallet. Jim goes to identify the body and is relieved it is not Scott. Scott (now Donovan) phones from a country hospital and explains he ran away from the school trip after being accused of rape and tried to hitch a lift but was mugged in the process. Soon after, Scott notices someone breaking into Number 24, the house next door to his. On challenging the intruder, he receives a punch for his troubles. Madge Mitchell arrives on the scene to discover it is her daughter Charlene, who has not seen Scott since they were children.\\r\\nScott befriends Mike Young. Scott and Charlene begin dating and go through teething problems. Scott proposes and Charlene accepts. Jim and Madge are against the engagement. Helen acts as a mediator and points out that Jim and Anne were roughly Scott and Charlene\\'s age when they got married. Scott and Charlene marry and soon move into Number 24 together. Their marriage\\'s first test comes when Jane Harris starts to help Scott with his HSC retakes, they become close and kiss. Charlene wants nothing to do with either of them upon finding out. Jane eventually convinces Charlene to give Scott another chance. Scott and Charlene\\'s marriage undergoes another test when Steve Fisher (Michael Pope) begins giving Charlene driving lessons and attempts to make advances on her, but Scott and Charlene reconcile towards their first anniversary.\\r\\nCharlene is offered a mechanic apprenticeship in Brisbane and is forced to make the difficult choice of leaving Erinsborough and the couple share an emotional farewell. Scott stays on at Number 24, but visits her frequently. During Charlene\\'s absence, Scott fights off the affections of Sylvie Latham and later Poppy Skouros, before moving to Brisbane for good. Scott and Charlene later have two children, a son Daniel (Tim Phillipps) and daughter named Madison (Sarah Ellen).\\r\\nThirty-three years following his departure, Scott returns to Ramsay Street with Charlene after being invited by Charlene\\'s cousin Shane Ramsay (Peter O\\'Brien). Scott and Charlene find that no one is home, so they go to Number 24 and reminisce over when they first met. During a Ramsay Street party, Scott and Charlene are reunited with Jane and Mike. Scott also sees Paul and Harold Bishop (Ian Smith), and they continue partying.\\r\\n\\r\\nReception\\r\\nFor his portrayal of Scott, Donovan won Most Popular New Talent at the 1987 Logie Awards. A year later, he won the Logie Award for Most Popular Actor and was nominated for the Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television. Donovan was again nominated for the Gold Logie in his final year on Neighbours in 1989.\\r\\nWhen the role was recast from Perkins to Donovan, some viewers protested the change. Shortly after his debut as Scott, Donovan was named one of the \"New Faces of \\'86\" by Jacqueline Lee Lewes of The Sydney Morning Herald. She said the network had already received feedback about his popularity. Kate Jackson and Sara Wallis of the Daily Mirror called Scott \"the boy next door\". Sue Heath from The Northern Echo joked that Scott\\'s mullet \"remains one of the great TV crimes of the century\". In 1998, writers from Inside Soap included Scott in an article about the top ten characters they wanted to return to soap, and they described him as \"a clean-cut boy next door who won the nation\\'s hearts when he married his sweetheart, Charlene.\" In a review of the serial, Linton Mitchell of the Reading Evening Post admitted to being a fan of Charlene, but did not like Scott, calling him a \"selfish drip of a husband\".\\r\\nIn her book Soap opera, Dorothy Hobson praised Scott\\'s on-screen relationship with Charlene, branding them positive, immense images for young people. Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture gave Scott a 3.5 out of 5 for his contribution to Neighbours, during a feature called \"A guide to recognising your Ramsays and Robinsons\". Deller said \"One of the many Robinsons to undergo a hair and face transplant, Scott soon transformed from a dull brunette into Jason Donovan. An all-round nice guy, Scott was part of the first (and best) iconic Neighbours teen gangs, with Jane, Mike and Charlene. She added that his relationship with Charlene was a \"Romeo and Juliet style romance\". In 2010, to celebrate Neighbours\\' 25th anniversary, satellite broadcasting company, Sky, included Scott in their feature of the 25 most memorable characters from Neighbours. Summing up his time in the serial, they stated: \"Scott Robinson is really only remembered these days for his teen romance, but his track record on the show could perhaps be better summarised in music. Early on, Scott formed a band with Mike \\'Guy Pearce\\' Young. He eventually married Kylie and made Angry Anderson the soundtrack of people\\'s memories of the eighties forever more.\" \\r\\nScott and Charlene\\'s wedding was seen by 20 million viewers in the United Kingdom and was voted the \"Most Romantic TV Nuptials of all Time\". The wedding episode made the cover of TIME magazine Australia and Minogue and Donovan\\'s promotional appearance at the Westfield Parramatta shopping centre caused a stampede among 4000 people. In October 2006, Australia Post brought out five stamps celebrating fifty years of television. Network Ten\\'s stamp featured both Minogue and Donovan as Charlene and Scott. Andrew Mercado, author of Super Aussie Soaps, observed that Scott\\'s romance with Charlene became hugely popular with Neighbours viewers in both the United Kingdom and Australia, helping the show to gain high ratings after an initial rocky start. In 2011, Scott\\'s wedding to Charlene was placed at number three in Channel 5\\'s \"Greatest TV Weddings\" programme. In 2015, a Herald Sun reporter included Scott and Charlene\\'s wedding in their \"Neighbours\\' 30 most memorable moments\" feature.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2000, Paul Brooks from Soaplife included Scott and Charlene in his list of \"dream lovers\". He assessed that they are \"Erinsborough\\'s own Romeo and Juliet\" that viewers \"were oohing and aahing to the love story\" of. He added that \"handsome\" Scott was \"the dream boyfriend\". In 2022, Kate Randall from Heat stated that Scott and Charlene were \"arguably the show\\'s most iconic characters with their wedding attracting more than 20 million viewers.\" Scott was placed at number nine on the Huffpost\\'s \"35 greatest Neighbours characters of all time\" feature. Journalist Adam Beresford described him as a \"nice guy\" and one half of \"the Neighbours golden couple\". He stated that viewers \"all soon became obsessed by their suburban Romeo & Juliet relationship.\" He called him one of the show\\'s original male pin-ups and their charm \"reflected a more innocent time.\" In a feature profiling the \"top 12 iconic Neighbours characters\", critic Sheena McGinley of the Irish Independent placed Scott as her seventh choice. She said that despite being played by two actors, \"when it comes to Scott Robinson, there\\'s only one face everyone remembers — that being a mini-mulleted Jason Donovan.\" Lorna White from Yours profiled the magazine\\'s \"favourite Neighbours characters of all time\". Scott was included in the list and White stated that the Scott and Charlene relationship boosted ratings.

He debuted with prose translation of Shakespeare in 1858 and quickly established himself as one of the leading contributors to the principal Georgian literary magazine Tsiskari. His works – full of satirical touches – are noted for their realistic portrayal of social life in old Tbilisi. His best known novella Solomon Isakich Mejganuashvili (სოლომონ ისაკიჩ მეჯღანუაშვილი, 1861) is a first-person life-story told by the eponymous hero of the Tiflis Armenian milieu, who starts modestly as a small tradesman and then turn to money lending so that the aristocracy also falls into his clutches. He now aims at becoming accepted in beau monde and wants to marry his daughter off to a Georgian prince Alexander Raindidze who, a well-bred and enlightened liberal man, is presented as a contrast to the character of Solomon. Of note are also Ardaziani's work Travelling by the Pavements of Tiflis (მოგზაურობა ტფილისის ტროტუარზედ, 1862), novel The Obedient Woman (მორჩილი, 1862) and polemic essays in the Georgian press.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==\", \"Gabriyelʹ Arkadyevich Ureklyan (Russian: Габриэ́ль Арка́дьевич Урекля́н; 15 December 1899 – 30 June 1945), better known as El-Registan (Эль-Регистан), was a Soviet Armenian poet.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nHe was born into an Armenian banker's family in Samarkand, in the Samarkand Oblast of the Russian Empire (present-day Uzbekistan). His father, Arshak (Russified to Arkadi) Ureklyan, fled to Tiflis from Ottoman-ruled Armenia in 1890s due to the Hamidian Massacres, and subsequently moved to Samarkand. He took the Bolshevik side during the Russian Civil War and the subsequent Soviet takeover of Central Asia. Embarking on a career as a reporter and writer, he adopted the nickname El-Registan, which was composed of a part of his first name and the Samarkand's most famous landmark, Registan. He worked in several prominent Central Asian newspapers, including Pravda Vostoka in Tashkent. He achieved prominence as a talented reporter and was invited to move to Moscow to work for the Izvestia. From there, he covered the massive Soviet construction and heavy industry-building campaigns  and became a prominent propagandist, such as the White Sea – Baltic Canal, Uralmash, etc. He also wrote movie scripts and radio plays, and El-Registan is perhaps better known for his script of the Soviet film Djulbars (1935). Composer Asya Sultanova set some of his work to music.\\r\\nAfter the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, El-Registan became a special war correspondent, frequently traveling to front lines. He attracted the attention of Joseph Stalin, and when he submitted his draft of the new Soviet anthem, written in collaboration with Sergey Mikhalkov, Stalin personally chose the draft and instructed the authors on the changes to be made. Eventually, it was adopted as the National Anthem of the Soviet Union in 1944.\\r\\nHe was married to Valentina Galanina, an actress in Moscow.

Sánchez, Figueroa, a daughter, and two sons were murdered  with an 18-inch chisel while asleep in their home. The 8-year-old boy was the only victim stabbed with a knife. The family driver, Alejandro Perez de la Rosa, around 27 years old, survived the attack but was left unconscious on the premises.\\r\\nThe family\\'s driver Perez confessed during the investigation that he and two other employed servants had murdered the journalists and their three kids.

García was the head of the Gulf Cartel, which controlled the Tamaulipas and Nuevo León areas at the time he was caught 14 January 1996. He was convicted two months before the murder. The United States had first put out a warrant for his arrest in 1993 and he had been on the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation\\'s FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives in 1995. Proponents of this theory believed Figueroa\\'s book and dedication to the attorney general made her a target. The style of the murder, however, did not match previous drug-related executions, and skeptics said the murders high visibility carried risks of a backlash against the cartels.\\r\\nAnother theory was that Bandaras had been taking bribes or was associated with the drug cartels and on its payroll while serving in the Federal Judicial Police. Bandaras could have also been involved in a crime ring.

He played a pivotal role in defining the concrete and non-figurative art movements in Argentina and was one of the precursors of kinetic, luminal, and hyrdokinetic avant-garde art. His work was revolutionary in that it used, for the first time in international art scene, water and neon gas as part of the artwork.\\r\\nHe created monumental sculptures, hydrospatial walks, hydrowalls, etc. Kosice is also known for his involvement in founding the Association Arte Concreteo – Invacion (AACI) and Grupo Madí. He made more than 40 personal and 500 collective exhibitions all over the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal life\\r\\nFerdinand Fallik, who later adopted the stage name Gyula Kosice as a tribute to his hometown, was born into an ethnic Hungarian family in Košice, Czechoslovakia on 26 April 1924. He lived there with his parents and two brothers until he was 4 years, at which time his family emigrated to Argentina aboard the Royal Mail Lines (RMS) Alcanatara steamship in 1928.\\r\\nIn 1932, at the age of 8, Kosice was orphaned and he and his two brothers were taken in by an immigrant companion of his father. As a child and a young adult, Kosice was an avid reader and frequently visited popular libraries where he discovered the inventions of Leonardo da Vinci. He also began to write poetry, which he continued doing for the rest of his life.\\r\\nKosice\\'s artistic career began in the 1940s as he started to collaborate and work alongside other ambitious artists who shared similar ideas about what art should be. He was involved in the formation of Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención (AACI) and Grupo Madí. For the remainder of his life, he remained a prominent figure in Arte Madí, continuing to contribute to magazine publications. He continued to create Madí paintings and sculptures, experimenting with new materials including stainless steel, aluminum, bronze, and plexiglass. One of his most notable works, Hydrospatial City, was created to propose an antigravity solution to Earth\\'s large and growing human population and is the subject of many of his publications. Kosice continued to participate in exhibitions and in the creation of monumental works all around the world.\\r\\nIn 1945, he met his wife and life-long companion Diyi Laãn. Laãn also was an artist and poet of the Arte Madí group but later gave up her own career to support Kosice and his artistic career\\r\\nIn 2005, he turned is workshop in Buenos Aires into a museum.\\r\\nKosice died in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 25 May 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly career – 1940s\\r\\nIn the early 1940s, Kosice started his first non-figurative drawings, paintings, and sculptures. He was inspired by Leonardo da Vinici\\'s to use science and invention to think to the future rather than focusing only on the present. He also wrote texts and poems about interdisciplinary art at this time.\\r\\nGyula Kosice\\'s art career really started in 1944. In the early 1940s Kosice started going to the Buenos Aires cafes where he met other poets and art enthusiasts. He debated poetry with Alberto Hidalgo and was introduced to Constructivism, the Bauhaus style, and European avant-garde art. It was there that he met the other concrete artists with whom he would later publish the Arturo magazine and form the AACI. The focus in his early art career was about concrete, nonobjective art and how it could radically change society for the better. He worked alongside many other Argentine artists who all shared the same idea that art should reference only itself and should only be made for its own sake. In 1944, he published the journal Arturo with Carmelo Arden Quin, Rhod Rothfuss, Joaquín Torres-García, Tomás Maldonado, and Lidy Prati. The journal had poems, artworks, and articles containing the artists\\' responses to constructivist art. That same year, he went with this group of artists to host Art concret invention and El movimiento de arte concreto-invención, a couple of private exhibitions on constructivist art in private homes. One of these private exhibitions was in the home of photographer Grete Stern.\\r\\nIn 1945, the same group of artists split into two separate groups in Buenos Aires. The first was known as the Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención, which was led by Tomás Maldonado, and consisted of Manuel Espinosa, Lidy Prati, Enio Iommi, Alfredo Hilto and Raúl Lozza along with four of his brothers. The other group was called Grupo Madí, which was founded by Kosice alongside Quin, Ruthfuss and Martín Blaszco. Grupo Madí was unique from AACI in that they wanted to include sculpture, design motifs, and architecture. This gave Kosice a venue to experiment with plastics, water, and neon in his works.  \\r\\nThe meaning of the group has been called into question many times, but Kosice claimed that the word \"Madí\" was made-up by the group and carried no meaning whatsoever. The main concern of this group was to reach out beyond the art community and to encourage people in all creative disciplines (such as dancers, architects, and actors) to carry the \"Madí spirit\". They did this by including articles in their published journals on poems written by others, general art theories, reports on musical events, photos of other exhibitions, and a \"Madí Dictionary\".\\r\\nOver the next few years, Kosice hosted many international exhibitions with this group of artists. In the Madí Manifesto that Kosice wrote, alongside the other group members, Kosice explained that Madí art is the \"absolute value\" of the presence and theme of the work, and that it was only to be expressed by nothing more than the unique formal characteristics of the creative discipline that it was made in. His examples were painting with color on a two-dimensional surface, or creating a sculpture that has \"movement\" but not adding or changing color.\\r\\nSeveral of Kosice\\'s early works embodied the very principles that helped define the AACI and Madí\\'s artistic goals. Royï (1944): Kosice created this piece during the time of the Arturo art group\\'s first exhibitions in 1944. One of the first artworks to depend on the viewer\\'s participation, Kosice created this wooden structure using hinges and wing nuts. The viewer is encouraged to move parts of the structure to position it as they want to, making this piece one of the first to rely on viewer participation. This artwork was made under the same ideas that define the Kinetic Art movement of the 1960s. Another artwork call Una gota de aqua acunada a todad velocité (1948) was the first artwork to incorporate water and contains a small, motored device that moves an acrylic box filled with water and air.\\r\\nIn 1947, Kosice hosted his first personal exhibition of Madí Art at the Bohemien Club in Galerías Pacífico (Buenos Aires, Argentina), which was the first totally non-figurative exhibition in Latin-America.\\r\\nIn 1948, he was involved in a Madí exhibition at Réalités Nouvelles, Paris. He was invited by Del Morle and the governing board. He received the collaboration of the France Cultural Attach in Buenos Aires, M. Weibel Reichard.\\r\\nIn the late 1940s, Kosice was the first to use neon lighting in his artwork, using them to create non-representational patterns in what he called \"Hydrokinetism\".\\r\\n\\r\\nLate career and death (1950s–2016)\\r\\nIn the late 1950s, Gyula Kosice started to create his motorized \"hydrokinetic\" sculptures that incorporated the use of neon light, plexiglas, aluminum, and water. These sculptures were Kosice\\'s experimentations with the perception of color, its motion, and how it can make the viewer feel visually unstable. The use of constantly shifting water combined with moving light was what created the feeling of instability as these elements were always in perpetual motion. These \"hydrokinetic\" sculptures had their roots in the concrete art movement, however they truly fit and thrived in the kinetic art movement. These artworks were exhibited in 1958 at the Galeria Densie René in Paris.\\r\\nIn 1965, Kosice made Columnas Hidroluz. Translated as \"Hydrolight Columns\", this work was made of plastic hemispherical containers that held cycling water inside. This work focused on the effects of light in shifting water on the viewer. As the water and air bubbles constantly moved, this work (and others like it) appeared to \"defy the laws of gravity\", which made the viewer feel unstable.\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Kosice started the Ciudad Hidroespacial project that proposed creating a classless society by building an entirely new city. For many years, he worked on this project. Kosice started this large and radical project out of his interest for space travel. He felt that contemporary architecture was centered around functionality for the powerful people in society more than anything else, and that this focus made the oppression of the lower class in Argentina much worse. He also wanted to model a futuristic urban habitat, which he envisioned spatial architecture that flowed without boundaries like water. Ciudad Hidroespacial consisted of many plexiglass models for architects to create a new large, self-sustaining cosmic city. It was also made of plastic, metal, and many other materials that were collaged onto pictures of cloudy skies.\\r\\nKosice was granted the Trajectory in Plastics Arts award by the Fondo Nacional de las Artes (National Arts Fund) in 1994. Also was granted the Platinum Konex Award in 1982, the Konex Merit Diploma in 2002, and the Konex Special Mention in 2012 (posthumous).\\r\\nKosice passed away in 2016 at 92 years of age.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegacy\\r\\nThroughout his lifetime, Gyula Kosice hosted more than 40 personal exhibitions and participated in 500 collective exhibitions all over the world.\\r\\nHe is remembered for his innovative contributions to the kinetic art movement in Argentina. He was the first to use neon light and gas, creating nonrepresentational patterns in his sculptures. He created many monumental sculptures, hydrospatial walks, and hydrowalls using these elements.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtwork\\r\\nRöyi, 1944\\r\\nEsculatra Articulada, 1946\\r\\nEstructura Lumínica Madí 6, 1946\\r\\nUna Gota de Agua Acundada a Toda Velocidad, 1948\\r\\nTalla Directa \"C\", 1953\\r\\nCírculos Lumínicos y Llíea de Agua Móvil, 1968\\r\\nAerolite, 1970\\r\\nViviendas Hidroespaciales en la Constelación de Yael, 1970\\r\\nConstelaciones No.1 – No.6, 1970–1972\\r\\nGota de Agua Móvil, 1980\\r\\nCilindro Luminoso y Esfera, 1989\\r\\nIndermitencia Lumínica, 2010\\r\\n\\r\\nMonuments\\r\\nTiempo Para Hidroespaciar, Caracas, Venezuela. 1968\\r\\nFaro de la cultura, Centenary of the founding of La Plata, Argentina. 1982\\r\\nEl Vuelo de la Paloma, La Paloma, Uruguay. 1985\\r\\nHomenaje a la Democracia, City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. 2000\\r\\nCorazón Planetario, Favaloro Foundation, City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. 2000\\r\\nTríada – Fuente del Milenio, Junín, province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. 2000\\r\\nRöyi, Museum of the Park, Portofino, Italy. 2009\\r\\nRöyi, Museum of Underwater Art (MUMART), Golfo Aranci, Sardinia, Italy. 2010\\r\\nJúblio, Kunsthalle, Košice, Slovakia. 2014\\r\\n\\r\\nSmall list of exhibitions\\r\\n1947\\r\\n\\r\\nGalerías Pacífico, Buenos Aires.

He worked as a book illustrator, graphic, painter, sculptor, stained glass artist, posters and furniture designer.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nAfter studying in Kalvarija and graduating from high school in Kaunas, Jonynas started art studies at the Kaunas Art School. Jonynas attended Adomas Varnas (painting) and Adomas Galdikas (graphics) studios. In 1931 he moved to Paris, where he earned a degree in xylography and book illustrating. Later he studied wood sculpture and cabinetmaker crafts in Ècole Boulle. In 1935 he held his first personal exhibition. After completing his studies in France Jonynas returned to Lithuania. His illustration for Kristijonas Donelaitis Metai became classics of the genre. At the time he was teaching at Kaunas Art School. In 1937 he was elected as a member of the International Sculpture Commission. The same year Jonynas was awarded Golden medal in the international exhibition in Paris for his woodcarvings and posters. In 1938 he was awarded a Cross of Order of the French Legion of Honour. From 1936 until 1941 Jonynas worked as preservation specialist in Lithuanian inspection of cultural heritage, later became chief of the organization.\\r\\nIn 1944 Jonynas retreated to Germany, where he lived until 1950. He then moved to the United States. He was active in Lithuanian cultural life in exile. With assistance from Schmittlein, Jonynas founded an art school in Freiburg im Breisgau (École des Arts et Métiers) and supervised it. In Germany Jonynas started illustrating bibliographic books again. One of his last works in xylography was illustrations for Raymond Schmittlein's study on Prosper Mérimée Lokis created in 1949. He also created illustrations for Shakespeare's Hamlet, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's die Leiden des Jungen Werthers, (published by Karl Alber; the illustrations were bought by the Goethe-Schiller Institute) and Le Siège de Mayence. Le Siège was the first book that Jonynas illustrated using aquarelle and not xylography.\\r\\nIn the United States Jonynas continued to illustrate books, although he changed his technique. During 1955–1979 Jonynas designed interiors for over 60 churches in the United States, Europe, and Australia. He also created a new technique joining stained glass, fresco and bass-relief when he was commissioned to create a mural at Rikers Island, New York. In 1955 he founded and art studio Jonynas and Shepherd Art studio, Inc. in New York. Jonynas also designed Chapel of Lithuanian Martyrs in St. Peter's Basilica and decorated Vatican City pavilion for the 1964 New York World's Fair. Jonynas taught at the Catan-Rose Institute of Fine Arts (1951–1957) and Fordham University (1957–1973).\\r\\nJonynas is also known for his designs of postal stamps for interwar Lithuania. He also designed over 50 stamps for the French Occupation zone in Germany (described as among the most artistic German stamps), France, and Vatican (1959). The Vatican stamp commemorated the 500th birthday anniversary of Lithuanian patron Saint Casimir. Jonynas was also asked to create a postal stamp for the United Nations to commemorate Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but the stamp was not printed due political reasons.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nVytautas Kazimieras Jonynas left a large number of graphics, stained glass works, sculptures, book illustrations. Jonynas brought back to Lithuanian most of his works. The largest collection of his works is preserved at his name art gallery-home in Druskininkai. Jonynas donated all of his creative works to Lithuania.

His more recent work has emphasized the interior of his sculptures, creating hollow spaces, often by joining pieces of wood in intricate ways. He believes the interior of these words guard the pieces’ energy. The exhibition 3 Casas Extraordinarias invites the onlooker to examine the interiors of three model houses. The three are made to be inhospitable, rather than comforting, such  as the one that “rains” on the inside.\\r\\nHe is inclined toward primitive figures, generally circles and sphere, with a minimalist view. He contrasts his work with the abundance of things and technology today, believing it is necessary to look at simple and “real” things.\\r\\nHis preferred material is wood, stating it is synonymous with life, nature and fertility.

He belonged to the Makonde people and lived most of his life in Dar es Salaam, the largest city in Tanzania. \\r\\nAlongside other African contemporary artists, his work was exhibited in international art shows, including Africa Remix 2004 or African Art Now in 2005. Through these exhibitions and the ensuing interest of art critics and collectors of contemporary African art, Lilanga became the internationally most renowned artist of Tanzania.\\r\\nIn the beginning, he worked in the Makonde artistic tradition of carving sculptures from wood. After having been exposed to other modern artists at the cultural centre Nyumba ya Sanaa (House of Art), he transformed typical sculptural forms into two-dimensional art works like paintings, etchings or panels. With this innovation, he developed his own style out of the Shetani (devils) figures of the modern Makonde sculptures. His paintings are characteristic for his colourful and ironic style, reflecting everyday life in Tanzania as he saw it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nThe exact place and date of Lilanga\\'s birth are uncertain, although he said that he was born in 1934 in the village of Kikwetu, Masasi district, in the Mtwara Region of southern Tanzania.\\r\\n\\r\\nLilanga\\'s parents were both Makonde (an ethnic group living both in Mozambique as well as Tanzania). His father was an agricultural labourer, who worked on the sisal plantations, and he had two brothers, who died before him. Lilanga attended primary school for only three years. In the works of his latter years, which were dedicated to village life, he returned many times to representation of his memories of happy moments, when school students received their diplomas.\\r\\nIn 1970, Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures and practising contemporary art. In 1971, he found his first employment, thanks to his uncle, Augustino Malaba, an already well-known sculptor, who would be his future collaborator. He started as a night guard at the House of Art (Nyumba ya Sanaa), a cultural centre for the development of African art and craftsmanship in Dar es Salaam. In 1982, he created wooden doors with clourful shetani figures for this cultural centre. After the Nyumba ya Sanaa was destroyed, these doors were bought and restored by a German collector and are documented in the book George Lilanga: The Doors of Nyumba ya Sanaa.\\r\\nAs a modern artist in his own right, he joined other artists like Robino Ntila, Augustino Malaba and Patrick Francis Imanjama. He also began to create paintings on batik cloth, on goatskin and on metal sheets for the finishing of railings and gates of the centre.\\r\\nLike other modern Tanzanian artists, Lilanga frequented the art circles of the increasingly successful Tingatinga school, but always maintained his own style. After 1972, he became essentially a painter, and some of his works were presented at Dar es Salaam\\'s National Museum in 1974.\\r\\nLilanga\\'s talents were recognized by Maryknoll Sister Jean Pruitt, an American aid worker promoting Tanzanian art. In 1977, he made his first journey outside Africa, travelling to New York, where he had a show at the Maryknoll Sisters\\' Ossining Center in New York State. He stayed for a brief time in Manhattan, selling prints made on paper or cardboard, standing on street corners.\\r\\n\\r\\nHealth issues and death\\r\\nIn 1974, he was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. \"I was always very tired, unable to follow my normal daily routine. Therefore, I decided to go in for a complete checkup in the local hospital. On that occasion, the doctors determined that I had diabetes.\"\\r\\nIn the late 1990s, his diabetes worsened with severe complications. Lilanga was forced to reorganise his work, putting together an atelier that included numerous young pupils and his own relatives, who were also sculptors and painters. They were closely supervised by Lilanga, and began to take over part of the work that Lilanga could no longer easily do by himself.\\r\\nIn 2000, the combination of diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease led to a rapid deterioration in Lilanga\\'s health. Due to gangrene, in October 2000 his right leg had to be amputated. In December of that year, the left leg was also amputated. Lilanga thus had to use a wheelchair; but after returning to his home in January 2001, he resumed his work.\\r\\nIn 2001, due to his serious physical impairments, he returned to small works with ink on paper and small goatskins 22.5 x 22.5 cm in size, which could be done more quickly and easily. With the assistance of his atelier, however, he also continued to create paintings of considerable size, and until shortly before his death, he produced large canvases, Masonites and tondos.\\r\\nLilanga died on Monday 27 June 2005, in Dar es Salaam, in his house-atelier at Mbagala.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtistic development & success\\r\\nShortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with wooden sculpture, made from roots, softwood and, later, ebony, and working in the Makonde tradition. He dedicated himself almost exclusively to this technique from 1961 until 1972. He showed his first works to Europeans who worked in the refugee camps during Mozambique\\'s war of independence. Following their advice, in 1970 Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures.\\r\\nIn 1978, he participated in a collective exhibition of African artists in Washington D.C. Of the 280 works presented, about 100 were by Lilanga. It was on this occasion that he was compared with Jean Dubuffet. Lilanga was considered to have had an influence on the young American graffiti artists (Keith Haring said in an interview that he had been influenced by Lilanga\\'s art). Lilanga began a long series of exhibitions. His works had increasing success in Africa, Europe, the US, India and Japan.\\r\\nIn the 1980s, Lilanga participated a few times in the Salzburg Summer Academy in Austria. There he learned the graphic method of etching, which became an important pictural experience for his later coloured art works. Subsequently, he dedicated himself almost exclusively to painting. His many pictures showing Shetani in different situations were represented two-dimensionally on Masonite (inexpensive panels made from wood fibre pressed, frequently used in African dwellings for stopping up attic roofs and as insulation), or on canvas, batiks and goat skin.\\r\\nIn the 1990s and with growing international recognition, his paintings became increasingly larger (from this period are his oils on canvas about one square meter in size, his first large canvases over 200 centimetres in length and 61x122-centimeter works on Masonite/Faesite). During this period, after a break of many years, and at the end of the 1990s, he began working intensely again with sculpture, creating a large number of carvings in soft wood (usually mninga or mkongo), vividly coloured with oil-based enamels.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegacy\\r\\nGeorge Lilanga\\'s colourful artworks underscore a whimsical evolution from traditional Makonde art, which is the source of the shetani fantastic creatures, depicted in virtually all of Lilanga\\'s paintings and sculptures. Traditionally, Makonde sculptors choose the finest woods for their pieces and would frown upon painting over the woods\\' natural textures. The bright enamel multi-colour painting technique pioneered by Lilanga gives his pieces a more contemporary aesthetic appeal and developed into a personal style that has made them popular with collectors and art dealers. As a result, Lilanga became a reference in African art and enjoyed considerable commercial success in the latter part of his life, and prices for his pieces were further boosted after his death in 2005.\\r\\nHowever, many pieces have been attributed by gallerists to George Lilanga based solely on their \\'Lilangalike\\' appearance.  Because pieces sold as \\'Lilangas\\' number in the many hundreds, it stands to reason that George Lilanga could not possibly have crafted them all himself, in particular in view of his frail health during the last decade of his life, when the bulk of such pieces was produced.\\r\\nThe reality was that George Lilanga mentored and inspired several artists who worked with him and capitalized on the value of the \\'Lilanga\\' label. After George Lilanga\\'s death, several of those artists and new ones continued to produce under the Lilanga attribution.\\r\\nGeorge Lilanga\\'s art works can be found in leading international collections like The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi or the Hamburg Mawingu Collection (HMC) of German collector Peter-Andreas Kamphausen. Shortly after the death of the artist, the HMC/George Lilanga Collection presented the first systematically and thematically complete catalogue of Lilanga\\'s work. In addition, the book explores the traditional roots of East African Makonde art, as well as four decades of Lilanga\\'s artistic development with different materials and techniques, including sculpture, paintings, etchings, drawings and metal works. Currently the HMC publish the George Lilanga News as an online blog with information about the artist, his art works, exhibitions and other interesting background material. Also in 2005, the African Collection series (Skira Editore, Milan) published a well-illustrated book on Lilanga\\'s work with useful information.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor exhibitions\\r\\nSolo\\r\\n\\r\\n2012 George Lilanga: Inside...Africa...Outside, Hamburg Art Week/Hamburg Mawingu Collection (HMC), Germany\\r\\n2005 George Lilanga, Jamaica, Milan, Italy\\r\\n2004 Tingatinga and Lilanga, Kouchi Prefecture Art Museum, Kouchi, Japan\\r\\n2003 Lilanga d’ici et d’ailleurs, Centre Culturel François Mitterrand, Périgueux, France\\r\\n2003 George Lilanga, Christa’s Fine Tribal Art Gallery, Copenhague, Denmark\\r\\n2002 George Lilanga, MAMCO, Geneva\\r\\n1999 George Lilanga \"Storie Africane\", Franco Cancelliere Arte Contemporanea, Messina, Italy\\r\\n1995 Lilanga Artist in Residence and Workshop, Hiroshima City Moderne Art Museum, Japan\\r\\n1994–1995 Lilanga\\'s Cosmos, Okariya Gallery\\r\\nGroup\\r\\n\\r\\n2010 African Stories, Marrakech Art Fair, Marrakech\\r\\n2007 Why Africa?, Pinacoteca Giovanni e Marella Agnelli, Turin, Italy\\r\\n2006 100% Africa, Guggenheim Museum, Bilbao, Spain\\r\\n2005 Arts of Africa, Grimaldi Forum, Monaco, France\\r\\n2005 African Art Now : Masterpieces from the Jean Pigozzi Collection, Museum of Fine Art Houston, USA\\r\\n2004 Africa Remix, Art contemporain d’un continent, in Paris, London, Düsseldorf and Tokyo\\r\\n2003–2004 Latitudes, Hôtel de Ville, Paris, France\\r\\n2002 Mapico Dance, MAMCO, Geneva, Switzerland\\r\\n2000–2001 Shanghai Biennale 2000, Shanghai, China\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nContemporary African art\\r\\nMakonde art\\r\\nCulture of Tanzania\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences and notes\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nKamphausen, Peter-Andreas / Hamburg Mawinga Collection (2005).

Arguably the most influential African artist of the 20th century, his pioneering career opened the way for the postcolonial proliferation and increased visibility of modern African art. He was one of the first African artists to win critical acclaim, having exhibited in august exhibition spaces in Europe and the United States and listed in international directories of contemporary art. Since 1950, Enwonwu was celebrated as \"Africa\\'s Greatest Artist\" by the international media and his fame was used to enlist support for Black Nationalists movement all over the world. The Enwonwu crater on the planet Mercury is named in his honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nBen Enwonwu was born a twin on 14 July 1917 into the noble family of Umueze-Aroli in Onitsha, Anambra State, southeastern region of Nigeria. His father, Omenka Odigwe Emeka Enwonwu, was a technician who worked with the Royal Niger Company. He was also a member of the Onitsha Council of Chiefs and a traditional sculptor of repute, who created staffs of office, stools, decorative doors and religious images. His mother, Chinyelugo Iyom Nweze, was a successful cloth merchant.\\r\\nUpon his father\\'s death in 1921, Enwonwu inherited his tools, going on to perfect the art of carving in the style of indigenous Igbo sculpture, begun earlier with his father, who first nurtured his precocious talent.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\nBetween 1921 and 1931, Enwonwu attended five primary schools: St. Joseph\\'s Elementary School, Onitsha (1926–28); St, Theresa\\'s Elementary School, Umuahia (1928–29); St. Mary\\'s Primary School, Port Harcourt (1929–30); Holy Trinity Primary; and St. Mary\\'s Primary School, both in Onitsha (1930–31). In 1933, Enwonwu attended St. Patrick\\'s School, Ibusa, and later enrolled at the Government College, Ibadan, completing his secondary education at Government College Umuahia in 1937. At both colleges, he studied fine art under Kenneth C. Murray. Murray was an education officer in charge of art education in the colonial civil service and later director of antiquities. During their time together, Enwonwu became Murray\\'s assistant and was recognised as one of the most gifted and technically proficient students of the \"Murray Group\" (Ben C. Enwonwu, C. C. Ibeto, D.L. Nnachy, M. Teze and A. P. Umana). The period of study under Murray marked the beginning of Enwonwu\\'s formal education in art.\\r\\nIn 1944, under a joint Shell Petroleum Company and British Council scholarship, he attended the prestigious Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London, and in 1945, the Ruskin School, Ashmolean, Oxford University, where the Slade had been relocated during World War II. In 1947, he received a first-class diploma in fine art from the Slade and registered for postgraduate work in anthropology (with a focus on West African ethnography) at the University of London. In 1948, Enwonwu completed his studies.\\r\\nNkiru Nzegwu states that the racist atmosphere he encountered during his stay in England sparked his interest in entering this programme. Anthropology offered a space for the scientific study of the races, their physical and mental characteristics, customs, and social relationships. In 1937, Murray exhibited Enwonwu\\'s work at the Zwemmer Gallery in London In 1969, he received an honorary doctorate degree from Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State, north-western region of Nigeria.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nAfter working with Murray for many years, Enwonwu was hired as a teacher at the Government College of Umuahia. According to Sylvester Ogbechie, author of Ben Enwonwu: The Making of an African Modernist, Murray was displeased with the university\\'s choice to provide Enwonwu with the same salary as the other seasoned teachers. This created a rift between both men. Eventually Murray left Government College and Enwonwu replaced him as art teacher. He continued his work as an art teacher in other various schools, including mission school in Calabar Province (1940–41), and Edo College, Benin City (1941–43). He was art adviser to the Nigerian government from 1948.\\r\\nDuring the years following 1950, he toured and lectured in the United States, and executed many commissions as a freelance artist. In 1951, he met with the founding members of the Lagos auxiliary to the Anti Slavery and Aborigines Right Society, which was at that time headed by Candido Da Rocha, and had James Johnson, Samuel Pearse, and Sapara Williams as members. and became their official art illustrator. From 1949 to 1954, Enwonwu held many art exhibitions within London, Lagos, Milan, New York City, Washington D.C., and Boston. In the course of her 1956 visit to Nigeria, Queen Elizabeth II commissioned and sat for a portrait sculpture by Enwonwu. At the Royal Society of British Artists exhibition in London of 1957, he unveiled the bronze sculpture.\\r\\nIn 1959, Enwonwu was appointed Supervisor in the Information Service Department office in Nigeria. He was a fellow of Lagos University (1966–68), cultural advisor to the Nigeria government (1968–71), and visiting artist at the Institute of African Studies at Howard University, Washington, DC, in 1971. He was appointed the first professor of Fine Arts at the University of Ife, Ile-Ife, from 1971 to 1975. He was also art consultant to the International Secretariat, Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture (FESTAC) in Lagos of 1977. The President of Nigeria, Shehu Shagari, presented a small sculpture of Enwonwu\\'s Anywanu, a representation of the Igbo earth goddess Ani, to Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on the occasion of his state visit to the United Kingdom in 1981.\\r\\nEnwonwu executed portraits of Nigerians as private commissions and illustrated Amos Tutuola\\'s 1958 novel The Brave African Huntress. He maintained a studio in London and was a Fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute, London.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact on the modern art world\\r\\nOgbechie describes his art as \"[the opening up of] third space in art history whose nature and parameters are at variance with art history\\'s exclusionary narratives of modernity and its inscription of the modern artist-subject as a white, Western European male\". Recognition of his bronze sculpture of the Queen proved that he, as an African modern artist, used his practice to develop a new kind of modern art whose ideals of representation and notions of artistic identity were different from conventional art-historical narrative of European modernist practice.\\r\\nTutu, a series of three portraits of the Ife princess Adetutu Ademiluyi (\\'Tutu\\'), were painted by Enwonwu in 1973 and have been missing since 1975. One of the three paintings was rediscovered in 2017 in a London flat. It was sold for £1,205,000 in an auction held by Bonhams. The portrait of Tutu, one of the three made by the painter, is a Nigerian national icon and considered a reconciliation symbol between the government and Biafran separatists after the civil war.\\r\\nA painting by Enwonwu, titled \"Owo Market\" and showing a marketplace scene in the Nigerian city of Owo, and dated 1949, was restored on the BBC programme The Repair Shop, broadcast on 7 August 2019. The painting\\'s owner had known Enwonwu, and described him as a lovely man always with a flower in his lapel and some of his work can be found in the Kakofoni Group Gallery.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotable works\\r\\nFrom the National Archives and Records Administration\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\r\\n\\r\\nPortrait of Chief Candido Joao Da Rocha (1951) which was exhibited during FESTAC LAGOS 1977\\r\\nAnyanwu (1954–55): Commissioned for the Nigerian National Museum in Lagos, still in situ.

He lives and works in Lisbon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nTropa attended the independent art college Ar.Co in Lisbon from 1987 until 1992. In 1992 he received a scholarship from the same institution to study at the Royal College of Arts in London. Between 1995 and 1996, Tropa held a scholarship from the Foundation Alfred Topfel at the Kunstakademie M�nster, Germany. From 1996 to 2007, he was a professor in the Department of Sculpture of Ar.Co.\\r\\nOver the years, Tropa has participated in a number of prominent exhibitions. The artist represented Portugal at the 54th Venice Biennale (2011), but also took part in the Istanbul Biennial (2011), Manifesta in Ljubljana (2000), the Melbourne Biennial (1999) and the Bienal de S�o Paulo in collaboration with Lourdes Castro (1998).\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nSince his first solo exhibition in 1991, Francisco Tropa has since been building his unique body of work grounded the fusion of naturally occurring phenomena with a decidedly human interest for the mythical and unexplained, incorporating historical and archeological elements into his oeuvre. Making use of a heterogeneous formal language, where sculpture, architecture, painting, photography, cinema and theater intersect, Tropa's work goes beyond the categorization of artistic genres. The artist relies mostly on primal materials in his installations, incorporating glass, metals, stone, wood, insects or sand, redefining their original character through transporting them in a process reminiscent of a modern alchemy. Unlike the traditional artist, Tropa �mixes art and technical ingenuity� to embrace �prototypes and machines, but also paintings, screen prints, photography and performance� in his curious yet engaging works. In this way, his projects create a complex scenic device by combining elements that are either manufactured, collected or specifically chosen by the artist, challenging a generally pre-established concept of perceived experience.\\r\\nTropa�s oeuvre is defined by a process of excavation, manipulating the passage of time to reveal new faces of known objects through the mechanical harnessing of natural processes. This approach can be seen, for example, in the Scenario projections, a long-standing series that merges the intricate technical elements of an electrical projection device with the mysterious nature of the origin objects, actively engaging the viewer in a timeless narrative that investigates questions of transience, temporality and transformation. Reproducing the image of various organic and inorganic objects, such as an hourglass, a dead fly, a small glass or even droplets of water descending down a thread, the devices duplicate the experience of the passage of time through the introduction of unexpected not-quite mirroring images using a simple machine. For example, one such piece titled Lantern projects the image of an hourglass onto a plaster screen, the device duplicating the experience of the passage of time with every grain of sand whose fall in unregulated intervals is reflected into the exhibition space. The viewer is able to examine the physical origin object as well the machine through which it is reproduced, and to interact with a reinvented reflection into the exhibition space.\\r\\nA similar approach can be seen in another one of his seminal works, titled STAE � shorthand for Sunken Treasures of Ancient Egypt. The complex installation links three individual chambers: �the underwater section�, �the looted chamber� and finally the �Terra platonica�. Each space contains its own narrative which spills over into the next, creating a seemingly incoherent but deeply interconnected collection of individual works, which come together into a single whole. Raising questions of metamorphosis, reconstruction and the fleeting human experience, the individual rooms contain unique storylines referencing everything from scientific history and early alchemist discoveries to Native American burial rites. An assemblage of geometric forms and automated appliances, the turbulent array of shapes and textures that make up each space take the viewer on an archeological exploratory mission. Shaped by the writings of Paul Scherbert and Raymond Roussel, the piece creates a unity out of seemingly incompatible  elements, such as the floating assembly of a cube and two spheres that make up Le songe de Scipion or an ethnographic film depicting a Native American building a box in L�influence Americaine.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\nSelected solo exhibitions\\r\\n2019: O Pirgo de Chaves / The Pyrgus from Chaves, Funda��o Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon, Portugal\\r\\n2018: Performance Scripta, L�invitation aux mus�es, Centre national de la danse, Paris, France\\r\\n2018: Le Grand Caf�, La Moustache cach�e dans la barbe.

He specialised in sculptures of animals, with a particular emphasis on big cats.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife\\r\\nAfter spending his childhood in Luxembourg, Auguste Tremont moved to Paris where he enrolled at the �cole Nationale des Arts D�coratifs in 1909. World War I caught him by surprise while he was visiting Luxembourg. As he tried to make his way back to Paris by passing through Switzerland, he was arrested by German forces near the Swiss border and was imprisoned. Once released from detention, he returned to Luxembourg where he remained until the end of the war in 1918, working in a steel factory in Dudelange. This work gave him the opportunity to practice his skills by drawing pictures of steel workers in action; he also befriended future Arbed president Aloyse Meyer.\\r\\nAt the end of the war, Tr�mont returned to Paris where he studied at the �cole des Beaux Arts. He first specialized in portraits and pictures of Paris and still life. This changed when he visited the Jardin des Plantes, the zoological gardens, where he found the subjects that were to become his main area of specialization: animals. Later in his life, when asked why he chose to represent animals, he replied: �because it was the most difficult task�.\\r\\nIn 1924, Tr�mont made his first sculptures, and he subsequently developed his skills as a sculptor by creating animal sculptures in a variety of sizes and species. The late 1920s-early 1930s were his most productive years; it is during this period that he sculpted, in Paris, two large lions that now decorate the entrance of the Luxembourg City Hall. He spent World War II in Paris, and returned to Luxembourg at the end of the war where he created monuments for the victims of the war. He later returned to his wonderful detailed still life and oil paintings of flowers and portraits. \\r\\nTremont's work was made available to the public through the Ruhlmann art gallery, then later Edgar Brandt and Malesherbes art galleries. His work is also represented on numerous Luxembourgian stamps.\\r\\n\\r\\nMajor works\\r\\nWorks by Tr�mont adorn some of the most prominent buildings in his hometown of Luxembourg City , including Notre-Dame Cathedral and Luxembourg City Hall.

In 1902, he enrolled in the Academia Portuense de Belas Artes but failed for \"inattention to study\" and thus interrupted his studies.

Diverse references converge in his work. \"Romantic, obsessed by Rodin\", interested in Bourdelle, he approached expressionism in many works (monument to Camões, 1911; bust of Camilo, 1913; etc.), in others he would be \"a purely classical sculptor\" (head of a woman, 1927; etc.) or perhaps even academic (Monument to Afonso de Albuquerque, 1930).\\r\\nIn his work one can highlight Torso de Mulher (or Baigneuse), 1923, where a \"more essentially lyrical expressive taste\" is present and which, according to José-Augusto França, is one of the best sculptural works of early Portuguese modernism.\\r\\nHe was the animator of reference exhibitions such as Cinco Independentes, (in which he participated, alongside Dórdio Gomes, Henrique Franco, Francisco Franco and Alfredo Miguéis as well as, by invitation, Eduardo Viana, Almada Negreiros, Mily Possoz), SNBA 1923, and the I Salão dos Independentes, SNBA, 1930.\\r\\n\\r\\nSculpture\\r\\nSculpted, among others, the busts of: \\r\\n\\r\\nAntero de Quental ( 1929 )\\r\\nSara Afonso ( 1927 )\\r\\nAntónio Botto ( 1928 )\\r\\nMário Eloy ( 1932 )\\r\\nsome of the statues to the monumental fountain of Alameda ( 1940–1942)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Eduardo L�pez Rivas (10 September 1850 � 22 July 1913) was a Venezuelan editor and journalist.

A multifaceted personality, he attempted multiple genre for his writing, including literary criticism, poetry, drama, novels, short stories, essays, as well as journalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nNkosi was born in a traditional Zulu family in a place called Embo in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. He attended local schools, before enrolling at M. L. Sultan Technical College in Durban.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater life\\r\\nNkosi in his early twenties began working as a journalist, first in Durban, joining the weekly publication Ilanga lase Natal (\"Natal sun\") in 1955, and then in Johannesburg for Drum magazine and as chief reporter for Drum\\'s Sunday newspaper, the Golden City Post, from 1956 to 1960.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterary career in South Africa\\r\\nHe contributed essays to many magazines and newspapers. His essays criticised apartheid and the racist state, as a result of which the South African government banned his works.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife as an exile\\r\\nNkosi faced severe restrictions on his writing due to the publishing regulations found in the Suppression of Communism Act and the Publications and Entertainment Act passed in the 1950s and 1960s. His works were banned under the Suppression of Communism Act, and he faced severe restrictions as a writer. At the same time, he became the first black South African journalist to win a Nieman Fellowship from Harvard University to pursue his studies. When he applied for permission to go to United States, Nkosi was granted a one-way exit permit to leave South Africa, thus being barred from returning. In 1961, accepting the scholarship to study at Harvard (1961�1962), he began a 30-year exile.\\r\\nIn 1962, he attended the African Writers Conference at Makerere University, along with the likes of Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong\\'o and Ezekiel Mphahlele. Moving to London, Nkosi obtained work with the BBC and between 1962 and 1965 produced the radio programme Africa Abroad, also interviewing major African writers for the television series African Writers of Today on NET, and serving as literary editor for The New African magazine (1965�1968). He appeared in Three Swings on a Pendulum, a programme about \"Swinging London\" in 1967, which can be viewed on BBC iplayer.\\r\\nIn 1970, he was visiting Regents professor at the University of California-Irvine, and having earned a BA degree in English literature from the University of London (1974) and an MA from the University of Sussex (1977), he went on to become a Professor of English at the University of Wyoming (1991�91), as well as holding visiting teaching positions at universities in Zambia and in Warsaw, Poland.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to South Africa\\r\\nLewis Nkosi returned to South Africa in 2001, after a gap of nearly four decades.  His final years before his death in 2010 were passed in financial difficulties and ill health. He was apparently injured in a car crash in 2009 and spent his time on the bed, slowly recuperating from the wounds; however, a recovery never really happened and he drifted towards death. Despite Nkosi being considered an African literary legend, none of his efforts in literature gave him any economic relief and his friends and fans gathered a charity fund to pay his last medical bills.\\r\\nNkosi died aged 73 on Sunday, 5 September 2010, at the Johannesburg Wellness Clinic. survived by his partner, Astrid Starck-Adler, and his twin daughters, Joy and Louise. A memorial service for Nkosi was held on 8 September at the Museum Africa, Newtown Cultural Precinct, in Johannesburg, and his funeral took place in Durban on 10 September.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nNovels\\r\\nThough Nkosi started his literary career in the 1960s, he entered the realm of fiction much later than his Drum colleagues. His first novel, Mating Birds, was published in 1986. His next novel, Underground People, came out in 2002 and his third novel, Mandela\\'s Ego, in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nMating Birds (1986)\\r\\nMating Birds is the narration of an educated South African black native called Ndi Sibiya. He narrates the story from prison, awaiting a death sentence. As a jobless youth Sibiya wanders the city of Durban and reaches the segregated beach. There he finds a white girl on the other side of the fence (on the white side of the beach). They silently exchange looks and enter into a muted affair. They were well aware that race laws in South Africa would sentence them to imprisonment if caught. The white girl intentionally allows her naked body to be seen by Sibiya. He takes the entire episode as a love affair between the white girl and himself. The girl with her regular appearances on the beach and seeming interest dupes Sibiya into believing her.\\r\\nAfter several silent meetings on the beach, Sibiya follows her to her bungalow, finds her lonely and willing, and enters into sexual copulation. But they are discovered by neighbours, and the white girl accuses Sibiya of rape. A trial by white judges begins. In the court, the white girl, Veronica, denies any knowledge of Sibiya and reiterates the charge of rape against him. The court finds Sibiya guilty and sentences him to death.\\r\\nThe novel generated a controversy and received critical attention, being awarded the Macmillan Silver Pen Prize in 1986. The New York Times declared the novel one of the best hundred books of 1986.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderground People (2002)\\r\\nNkosi\\'s second novel, Underground People, is a political thriller. In this novel, he moved away from the theme of inter-racial sexual relations and centred the story on the armed struggle in South Africa.\\r\\nCornelius Molapo is a language teacher and a member of the National Liberation Movement, an organisation waging armed war against the racist white minority government. He is a poet, a great orator, hungry reader of many books, and even plays cricket. He often criticises the policy of the Central Committee and irks its members. To counter him, they draw a strategy. The Central Committee of the Organization advises Cornelius to go to a remote part of the country called Tabanyane and to participate in peasant uprisings. The Central Committee plans to make use of his absence from mainstream life into an act of abduction by the Government. At first he hesitates, but reluctantly agrees. After reaching Tabanyane, Cornelius organises the poor illiterate jobless country men into revolutionary men and leads them. In this task, he enlists the support of Princess Madi, who is a daughter of the deposed chief of Tabanyane. During the clandestine operations, he takes two white hostages into his custody. However, he is unwilling to execute the unarmed civilians.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Central Committee starts a big propaganda about the disappearance of Cornelius from duties. They blame it on the South African police, who deny any knowledge of him. The National Liberation Movement brings the matter to international organisations including the United Nations and Human Rights International. The latter sends its official Anthony Ferguson, who was born in South Africa and immigrated to England, to investigate the matter. Anthony\\'s sister and mother are still living in South Africa. After some rest he undertakes to search for Cornelius unsuccessfully.\\r\\nThe Central Committee members, plagued by jealousy of his success as a revolutionary, want to use the issue of white hostages for the release of their leader from prison, engage in talks with the Government and to observe a ceasefire. But contrary to the expectations of the Central Committee, Cornelius defies them and conducts attacks on the police stations and other locations. To escape police persecution, Cornelius leaves his hideout, and allows the white hostages to leave unharmed. The white hostages reach police and recognise Cornelius\\'s photo and confirm his active presence in the fight.\\r\\nNaturally, police suspect the intentions of Anthony Ferguson and ask him to go to Tabanyane, to convince Cornelius to surrender. He takes the help of a member of the Central Committee and reaches Tabanyane. However, Cornelius refuses to surrender and ditch the people for whom he had been fighting. Eventually, the police shoot, and he dies.\\r\\n\\r\\nMandela\\'s Ego (2006)\\r\\nNkosi\\'s third novel, Mandela\\'s Ego (2006), is the story of Dumisani Gumede, a teenage boy who has come of age in a Zulu village and runs after every girl and woman to satiate his newly acquired power. His uncle Simon tells him many stories about Nelson Mandela and makes him a follower of the great leader. Uncle Simon\\'s storytelling is invested with lies and half-truths. He also tells Dumisani that Mandela is a great pursuer of women. Taking cue from the \"real life\" of Mandela, Dumisani goes unstopped in his conquests. In his village, every girl falls for his charms except Nobuhle, a beautiful orphaned girl. Dumisani\\'s admiration for Mandela goes to the extent of starting a football club, with Dumisani as its chairman. He even goes to the city of Pietermartizburg to see Mandela, who comes there to address a convention demanding equal rights for all races and a dialogue among all the races.\\r\\nAfter his schooling, Dumisani joins a tourist company as a guide. Dumisani\\'s friend Sofa Sonke, driver of the tourist bus, brings every day a newspaper from Durban for him. After many attempts to win Nobuhle, Dumisani finally succeeds and gets accepted by her. She invites him to meet her on the river bank. On the same day, Dumisani receives the news of Mandela\\'s arrest. The news shocks him and takes his nerve away. When Dumisani tries to unite with Nobuhle, his body fails. He tries again but his sexual energy deserts him. Nobuhle leaves in tears.\\r\\nDumisani consults many witch doctors, tribal doctors and conventional doctors in hospitals. But nothing works to cure him. He leaves his home, wanders the country aimlessly for years. When he reaches middle age, one day he hears the news of Mandela\\'s release from prison. He attends the first public address of Mandela after the release. He rejoices. In his joy, he huddles a woman next to him, and his lost sexual urge returns. His life is restored.\\r\\nMandela\\'s Ego was shortlisted for the 2007 Sunday Times Fiction Award.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrama\\r\\nNkosi\\'s plays include The Black Psychiatrist and some drama for radio.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoetry\\r\\nNkosi\\'s few poems include \"To Herbert Dhlomo\" in Ilanga lase Natal (22 October 1955). Ntongela Masilela notes that, despite Nkosi\\'s early promise, \"in his whole life he wrote seven poems, the last one written in Lusaka in the early 1980s where he was then living and published at that time in Sechaba, the political and cultural review of the African National Congress.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nShort stories\\r\\nNkosi wrote a good number of short stories. His story of police violence and popular resistance in a black township, \"Under the Shadow of the Guns\", appeared in the 1990 anthology Colours of a New Day, the book taking its title from an optimistic phrase used by one of the characters in Nkosi\\'s story.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterary criticism and journalism\\r\\nHe wrote critical essays on many issues, including politics, history, African affairs, American culture, and civilisation. No other critic touches upon such diversified themes. His critical works include Home and Exile (1965), The Transplanted Heart (1975), and Tasks and Masks: Themes and Styles of African Literature (1981). His essays and other works were published over four decades in America, England and Africa. Publications in which his writing appeared include Drum, Ilanga lase Natal, Golden City Post, Transition, The Guardian, The Africa Report, Afro-Asian Writings, Sechaba, New Society, The Spectator, New Statesman, The Observer, Negro Digest, Black Orpheus, Fighting Talk, Contact, The African Guardian, Southern African Review of Books, London Review of Books, Gen�va-Afrique, The New African, and Harvard Crimson.\\r\\n\\r\\nThemes\\r\\nAs opposed to apartheid, Nkosi\\'s work explores themes of politics, relationships, and sexuality. His works, possessing great depth, received less recognition than they had actually deserved. In the post-apartheid era, his works are gaining critical attention across the third world.  Nkosi joined forces with African powerhouse authors Chinua Achebe and Wole Soyinka in an interview in the third chapter of Bernth Lindfors\\' Conversations With Chinua Achebe. In 1978, Nkosi and composer Stanley Glasser wrote a collection of six Zulu-style songs called Lalela Zulu for The King\\'s Singers, a group of six white British, male a cappella singers.\\r\\n\\r\\nQuotations\\r\\nOn the situation in South Africa during apartheid\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Africans have learned that if they are remaining sane at all it is pointless to try to live within the law. In a country where the Government has legislated against sex, drinks, employment, free movement and many other things, which are taken for granted in the Western world, it would take a monumental kind of patience to keep up with the demands of the law. A man\\'s sanity may even be in question by the time he reaches the ripe age of twenty-five.\" (Nkosi: Home and Exile, 22)\\r\\nOn black writers and their literature\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Black South Africans did not produce on elite which was alienated form the black masses or even from the conditions of everyday life under which our people laboured. In South Africa we were saved from the emergence of Black Bourgeoisie by the leveling effect of apartheid.\" (Nkosi: Home and Exile, 32)\\r\\nOn his exile\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A writer needs his roots; he needs his people perhaps more than they need him in order that they should corroborate the vision he has of them, or at least, to dispute the statements he may make about their lives.\" (Nkosi: Home and Exile, 93)\\r\\nOn the writers and commitment\\r\\n\\r\\n\"�whether we consider ourselves revolutionaries or not, are playing a marginal role. We may be good for propaganda; we may raise some money and build up contacts for the people of South Africa-but there is no such thing as a revolution fought in exile, without a base among the oppressed masses of the country for which the change is desired.\" (Nkosi: On South Africa, 286�292)\\r\\n\"Ambushed by history, deprived of the moral and material support of the socialist camp by the fall of the Soviet Union and its satellite states, a negotiated peace, between a lame government and weary liberation movements was probably the next best thing.� The negotiated peace enacted what Doris Somer, writing about the South Africa, described as a premature end of a history.\" (The Republic of Letters: Mandela�s Republic)\\r\\n\\r\\nCritical appraisal and research\\r\\nThe first comprehensive and critical review on Nkosi appeared in 2006, edited by Professor Lindy Steibel and Professor Liz Gunner, entitled Still Beating the Drum: Critical Perspectives on Lewis Nkosi, published by Wits University Press.\\r\\nNkosi\\'s works are gaining recognition and being prescribed as university and college textbooks.

His work is characterized by a strong ethnic component and he made extensive use of local materials.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife and works\\r\\nNarváez was the son of a cabinetmaker and restorer. While he was still very young, the family moved to Caracas and he began his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1928, he left for Paris where he attended the Académie Julian and established connections with the artistic community in Montparnasse. He returned to Venezuela in 1931 and, a few years later, began to work with the architect Carlos Raúl Villanueva, who commissioned him to supply sculptures for his projects, including the Plaza of Carabobo Park, the facade for the Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Natural Sciences and the Plaza O\\'Leary.\\r\\nIn 1939, he travelled to New York to decorate the Venezuelan pavilion at the World\\'s Fair and exhibited his works \"Café y Frutas\" (now in the Andrés Bello Lyceum) and \"Perlas y Cacao\" (now in the Fermín Toro Lyceum).\\r\\nIn 1941, Narváez received the Premio Nacional de Escultura of Venezuela, and, in 1948, the Premio Nacional de Pintura of Venezuela. The recognitions established him as a leader of modernism in Venezuela. \\r\\nIn 1952, he completed an equestrian statue of General Rafael Urdaneta which is now on display in the Plaza La Candelaria. Later, he collaborated with Villanueva to create several pieces for the University City of Caracas, which was conceived as a \"synthesis of the Arts\". \"Education\", \"Science\", \"The Athlete\" and the bust of José María Vargas are some of his works located on the campus of the Central University of Venezuela.\\r\\nIn 1981 and 1982, he created two sculptures of monumental proportions. One of them, \"Gran Volumen\", was made for the Amuay Refinery Complex and the other, one of his last completed works, the \"Armonía de Volúmenes y Espacio\", was for Caracas Metro. It is located in a plaza that was later named for him.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nArt of Francisco Narváez in University City of Caracas\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nFundación Francisco Narváez: Chronology(in Spanish)', 'Hananuma Masakichi (花沼 政吉, 1832-1895) was a Japanese sculptor specializing in \"iki-ningyo\" or lifelike dolls. A number of his works have survived in American and British collections, notably those of Ripley\\'s Believe It or Not! and the Sheffield Museum (the home town of the father of the Deakin Brothers of Yokohama, dealers in oriental art and curios in the 1890s). One such figure shows a naked Japanese man anatomically correct down to hairs inserted in his gofun skin, holding a small mask in his hand (i.e. a mask sculptor), about life-size. This was exhibited in San Francisco during about 1895–1906, and was depicted on a souvenir token from the Art Saloon, its owner at the time. It was reputed to be a self-portrait of the artist. Elaborations of the legend about this very lifelike image continued up through the time of the image\\'s purchase by Ripley\\'s in 1934, Robert Ripley would often put the statue in guest rooms at night in order to scare them. His house on B.I.O.N (Believe It or Not) Island had a slew of other strange collectibles including this. through its exhibit at the Chicago World\\'s Fair in 1934, and into the present. The story below is a version of this romantic tale.\\r\\nBelieving that he was dying from tuberculosis, Hananuma sculpted a life size statue of himself as a gift to the woman he loved, which was completed in 1885. The artist himself died 10 years later, in poverty aged 63.\\r\\nThe statue is renowned for being nearly identical in appearance to its creator. Made of between 2000 and 5000 wooden strips (reports differ), it is connected only by dovetail joints, glue and wooden pegs. No joint is visible on the statue, and it is lacquered to show every detail of Hananuma, including muscle, bone and vein. The artist also manufactured anatomically correct glass eyeballs for the statue. Finally, individual holes were drilled in the statue to represent the pores of the skin, and the corresponding hair inserted.\\r\\nThe statue was later purchased by Robert Ripley in 1934, and was housed in his California Odditorium until his death in 1949. After Ripley\\'s death, the masterpiece toured various Odditoriums until it was stored in the Los Angeles Odditorium where it was damaged in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The statue is currently on display in the Amsterdam Odditorium, located on Dam Square and a replica is in the London Odditorium, located at 1 Piccadilly Circus.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nRipley\\'s Believe It or Not!\\r\\nFine art\\r\\nSculpture\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nThe statue\\r\\nThe Wrestlers by Hananuma Masakichi\\r\\n\"Jap Statue\" token from the San Francisco Art Saloon, now in the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Arturo Ambrogi (1874 – 1936 in San Salvador, El Salvador) was a writer and journalist, considered one of the pioneers of Salvadoran literature, along with Francisco Gavidia and Alberto Masferrer.

While working at the Royal Danish Porcelain Factory, he  designed a number of delicately decorated figurines. He is however remembered above all for his statues celebrating the female form.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nAfter attending the Technical School in Copenhagen (1892–94), he worked for a couple of years as a house painter\\'s apprentice before spending the winter of 1897–98 in Gothenburg. There he met the Swedish painter Ivar Arosenius (1898–1902) whose friendship greatly influenced his early work as a painter and illustrator. Their circle of friends was also inspired by the British illustrator Aubrey Beardsley whose erotic style is also reflected in Henning\\'s early work. In 1931, Henning became a Danish citizen.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nIn 1909, Henning began to work for Copenhagen\\'s Royal Porcelain Factory where, apart from an interruption from 1914 to 1920, he continued to be employed until 1925. There he met and married china painter Gerda Heydorn, who later became a noted textile designer with whom he occasionally collaborated.\\r\\nAlthough he had never had instruction specifically in sculpture, he created sophisticated little groups of figures, often in erotic situations inspired by 18th century French art. But after he had met Kai Nielsen and had studied the sculptural works of Auguste Rodin, Aristide Maillol and some of the classical works in the Glyptothek, his approach developed along more personal and monumental lines. Henning showed an early interest in classical poetry, especially Ovid\\'s Metamorphoses, which inspired him to create a number of amorous figures such as Cupid with Psyche and Pygmalion with Galathea. His main theme was however the naked female figure which he initially developed in collaboration with Kai Nielsen. His statuette of a \"Reclining Girl\" (1914) led to Nielsen\\'s \"Leda without the Swan\" which in turn encouraged him to experiment with larger formats. His large female figures began with the bold \"Danae\" (1927) and was soon followed by the voluptuous \"Girl Standing\" (1929).\\r\\nAround 1930, he altered his style with his \"Moder Girl\", a slender, short-haired figure in contrast to the heavier bushy-haired figures inspired by antiquity. During the 1930s, he added shoes and socks to his naked figures but soon omitted them again. His \"Seated Girl\" (1938) is based on a complex diagonal theme but stands in calm, harmonious equilibrium like his \"Reclining Girl\" (1943). He worked on his last large sculpture \"Susanne\" (1964) for a full 10 years, drawing on his sketches of Pygmalion and Galatea from 1919 to 1920. His work was part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoyal Copenhagen figurines\\r\\nOne of the finest works executed by Henning while he was at the Royal Copenhagen factory was \"The Princess on the Pea\" inspired by Hans Christian Andersen\\'s fairy story. With meticulous attention to detail, Henning has depicted a series of images on the many surfaces of the glazed sculpture including Chinese dragons, Persian warriors and children at play. Created in 1911, the following year the piece was awarded the First Class Medal at the Paris Salon where it was considered to be one of the finest pieces of European porcelain of the times.\\r\\nOther overglazed figurines include three Fairy Tale couples (1912–1914), Moongirl (1913), (Satyr and Nymph (1910), Cupid and Psyche (1914), Grief (1914), Venus (1924), and Susanne (1924).\\r\\n\\r\\nAssessment\\r\\nWith his appreciation of the curvature and tension of the female form, Henning is one of the most important contributors to the female figure in Danish sculpture. In 1937, Henning was awarded the Thorvaldsen Medal and in 1955 received the Prince Eugen Medal.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nGerhard Henning sculptor images from Google images', 'Ivan Bogorov (Bulgarian: Иван Богоров) (1818–November 1, 1892) was a Bulgarian encyclopedist from the time of the National Revival.

In 1841, he published the Bulgarian coat of arms from Hristofor Zhefarovich\\'s Stemmatographia (1741). For some time, Bogorov travelled to Bucharest, Svishtov, Veliko Tarnovo, Kazanlak (which he called \"Izvornik\") and Gabrovo before settling in Stara Zagora (\"Veta Zagora\"). He promoted education in Bulgarian as opposed to Greek during his journeys. In Stara Zagora, he wrote the first Bulgarian grammar book, which he printed in Bucharest in 1844. He then moved to Leipzig (\"Lipiska\"), where he issued the first Bulgarian newspaper, Balgarskiy orel (Bulgarian Eagle) in 1846, two years after Konstantin Fotinov\\'s first Bulgarian magazine, Lyuboslovie. Bogorov returned to Istanbul, where he worked for the Tsarigradski Vestnik newspaper, and then moved to Paris to study medicine. After that, Bogorov settled in Plovdiv to work as a doctor. There, he also issued the Journal for Science, Handicrafts and Trade. He participated in the release of several other newspapers, journals and books, and prepared the Academic Bulgarian Dictionary and the first French-Bulgarian (1869) and Bulgarian-French (1871) dictionary.

He was born in Porto, Portugal, where he is currently living. Manuel Casimiro has spent a large part of his life living abroad, especially in Nice, France where he went to live after he was wounded in Portuguese Angola during the Portuguese Colonial War.\\r\\nManuel Casimiro is the son of the late film director Manoel de Oliveira.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife\\r\\nManuel Casimiro was born in a quite affluent family but only decided to devote himself entirely to his artistic pursuit after the Angolan war where he fought and was wounded. When he left Portugal to live abroad, mainly in Nice, France, he did not rely on family resources and lived in semi-poverty for many years. The generous friendships that he forged during that period helped him through his hardship and were to last for his whole life, particularly with people such as Vincent Descombes, Jean-François Lyotard, Michel Butor. The articles they published on Manuel Casimiro’s work account for their appreciation of the man and the artist. \\r\\nIn 1978 he lived for one year in New York where his first major collective exhibition took place. He managed to sell a few painting which enabled him to travel Northern European countries and Italy where he spent some time, especially in Venice. There he met and photographed Peggy Guggenheim in her foundations, only shortly before she died in 1979. This meeting was to have a lasting influence on Manuel Casimiro and the photography was to become the subject matter for an intervention.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected exhibitions\\r\\nManuel Casimiro has presented many individual and collective exhibitions and here are listed some of the major ones.\\r\\n\\r\\n1978: The Cooper-Hewitt Museum, New York,  exhibited a collection of works by Robert Motherwell, Douanne Michaelis, David Hockney and Manuel Casimiro and many others. This collective exhibition was then displayed in New York, Tokyo, London, Paris and Berlin. Oedipus Explaining the Enigma, an intervention work by Manuel Casimiro, was exhibited.\\r\\n1980: Manuel Casimiro represented France in various international events, as in 1980 at the D.A.A.D in Berlin, Germany for the exhibition Nice in Berlin, or in 1981 in São Paulo, Brazil at the Museum of Modern Art of the São Paulo University.\\r\\n\\r\\n1986: In Nice, France Casimiro contributed to the exhibition Peindre, Photographier along with Christian Boltanski, Louis James, Annette Messager, Robert Rauschenberg. On this particular occasion, Manuel Casimiro chose to make two interventions on two Orientalist paintings in the Jules Chéret Museum by painting ovoids with erasable paint.\\r\\n1988: The National Museum Soares dos Reis in Oporto exhibited a collection of works about the Portuguese myths The Ghosts of King Sebastian. This exhibition was also displayed in Bari, Italy in 2006.\\r\\n1996/1997:  The Museum of Contemporary Art of Serralves  in Porto under the lead of Jean-Hubert Martin, organized a retrospective of Manuel Casimiro’s work entitled Manuel Casimiro 1964-1996. The Museu Serralves edited a 145-page catalog with texts by important personalities interested in the arts, such as Michel Butor, Jean-François Lyotard, Jean-Hubert Martin, Christine Buci-Glucksmann, Giulio Giorello, Raphael Monticello, José Augusto França, Eduardo Lourenço,  António Cerveira Pinto, Bernardo Pinto de Almeida, Agustina Bessa Luís and others. As reported by Museu Serralves this institution has several works of Manuel Casimiro in its collection.\\r\\n2002:  As part of the opening of Salamanca Capital of Culture  2002, two exhibitions were organized: Bridges and The Imaginary Museum.\\r\\n2003: In an exhibition called Playing with Scales, the Galician Center of Contemporary Art exhibited photographs by Manuel Casimiro which dated back to 1972 and which were part of a work called City. These photographs were displayed opposite more recent works by other artists and showed their very topicality some 30 years later.\\r\\n2004: On the occasion of an exhibition called Chocolate Manuel Casimiro published a collection of texts entitled Neither Antique, Nor Modern. In one of the articles  Manuel Casimiro strongly criticizes the development of the financial system that the art market has become.\\r\\n2009:  The Belém Cultural Center in Lisbon exhibited Caprichos, a series of interventions by Manuel Casimiro on Goya’s work. Michel Butor contributed to the exhibition with a few texts on Goya and Manuel Casimiro’s works. They were published along others texts by Manuel Casimiro to illustrate the objectives of these interventions and to try to decipher the hallmark of his creative work, the ovoid.\\r\\n2017: In 2017 the curators of The New Art Fest selected a work of Casimiro for the 2017 edition of the Lisbon-based new media festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ovoid\\r\\nWhen considering Manuel Casimiro’s work it is necessary  to bear in mind that he gives a paramount importance to the idea within the work of art, the “cosa mentale” in Leonardo da Vinci’s words. The ovoid, and its use in interventions and other works, provides a focal point around which the work of art is re-evaluated and reconsidered. The artists himself seldom talks about the ovoid leaving it to the spectator to supply meaning within that void form.\\r\\n\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nCaprichos, Michel Butor [1] (2008) ISBN 978-972-8955-87-8\\r\\nManuel Casimiro, Fátima Lambert (2006) ISBN 972-21-1712-2\\r\\nNem antigo nem moderno, Manuel Casimiro (2005) Dep.

His family was an ethnic minority of Sudeten Germans living in the Sudetenland.\\r\\nAfter graduation, Katz studied law at The German University in Prague. During his studies, he wrote for a variety of newspapers and magazines. Upon graduation, he began work with the now defunct Vossische Zeitung newspaper in their Prague office. During this placement, he spent a year in East Asia working as a traveling reporter.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer in journalism\\r\\nAfter the First World War, Katz moved to Leipzig and in 1924 he became director of the Leipzig Publishing Company, a position he held for two years. In the years between 1928 and 1930, he was a clerk for the Ullstein publishing house in Berlin. While working in this position, Katz founded the Green Post, a periodical which very quickly reached a circulation of over one million. The financial success allowed Katz to establish himself as an independent writer, giving him the freedom to travel the world while writing of his experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\nTravel and publication\\r\\nDuring the period between 1925 and his death, Katz published nearly thirty-five volumes, mostly personally written journalistic travel books. In the late twenties, his five-book series Die Weite Weite Welt (The Wide, Wide World) emerged, including Ein Bummel um die Welt, Funkelnder Ferner Osten, Heitere Tage mit braunen Menschen, Schnapps Kokain und Lamas, Ernte (name translations below). His other areas of interests were animals � specifically dogs � and gardening. Some of his most refreshing works center around the personalities of dogs, and the methods one must employ to be a successful gardener.\\r\\nIn 1933, Katz emigrated to Switzerland.

He sculptured renowned  Roman Catholic wood statues such as the Blessed Virgin Mary in what is now Bolivia, known as Our Lady of Candles (also known as Our Lady of Copacabana), one of the most celebrated Marian images located at Lake Titicaca in Bolivia.\\r\\n\\r\\nBackground\\r\\nYupanqui was born in Copacabana of Tola and Francisco Tito Yupanqui Sr. His family was Anansayas, or descendants of Quechua people who relocated to Copacabana with the Inca. He came from a family recently converted to Roman Catholicism by the Dominican priests but like many of the time, retained some of the Aymara religious beliefs.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Lady of Copacabana\\r\\nUnder the influence of the Dominicans, Yupanqui's monotheistic beliefs increased while studying religion, and they started admiring the works of European religious art. Legend has it that one night, a beautiful woman carrying in her arms a child appeared in the fourth month of the Indian calendar and was charged with the task of making the image. This image later became known as Nuestra Senora de Virgen de la Candelaria or Our Virgin Lady of the Candles. Father Antonio Montoro, who was the presiding parish priest at the time insisted that the image of the virgin be likened to European faces, but Yupanqui insisted that the face of the statue be likened to the native people of Bolivia.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater art career\\r\\nLater in his life, Yupanqui created three other replicas of his famed Marian image and sent them to three different places.

Eventually the charges were dropped and, after a governmental change, the couple were permitted to return to Panama. Documents released in March 2010 by the British government showed that they were both involved in the unsuccessful coup attempt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitics\\r\\nIn May 1964, Arias was elected to the National Assembly, his first venture into active politics. Two months later, he was shot in an argument with a friend and former political associate, Alberto Jiménez, on a street corner in a suburb of Panama City. It was widely rumored that the shooting was a result of an affair that Arias was having with Jimenez\\'s wife. Arias was treated for 18 months in British hospitals and spent the rest of his life as a quadriplegic, using a wheelchair. One of the reasons Fonteyn continued to dance so late in life was to pay Arias\\' enormous medical bills. Colette Clark, a close friend who worked with Fonteyn on Royal Academy of Dance galas, said:\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople said it was such a tragedy, his being shot. Of course it wasn\\'t a tragedy, because she got what she wanted. Someone to look after and love and lavish with all the devotion and strength of her marvellous character.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal life and death\\r\\nDuring Fonteyn\\'s absence from Panama on tour as a ballerina, a socialite named Anabella Vallarino would move into the house as his shadow wife and move out again before Fonteyn\\'s return. On the day of Arias\\' death on 22 November 1989, Vallarino committed suicide by swallowing a bottle of chlorine, and the two were buried on the same day.\\r\\nIn addition to Fonteyn, Arias was survived by two daughters, Querube Brillembourg and Rosita Vallarino; a son, Roberto Arias; two brothers, Harmodio and Gilberto; a sister, Rosario de Galindo, and six grandchildren.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'J.

Casimir\\'s essay \"What Ails Dominica\", published in the Negro World in 1920, resonated with readers in dealing with dissatisfaction to colonial rule in the Caribbean. He acted as the Dominican agent for Negro World and for other black periodicals such as The Crisis (edited by W. E. B. Du Bois). Under the pseudonym \"Civis Africanus\", he contributed \"dozens of Pan-Africanist-oriented poems\" to the Negro World, and after the publication was officially banned in West Africa, sent copies to the editor of the Gold Coast Leader, J.

He is most known for his bronze sculptures. Most of his artwork deals with the ideas of freedom, oppression, genocide and suffering. In 1971, he was commissioned to make a statue of Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah. He is most known for his Box series, Sabra and Chantila, Hunger and Mother.\\r\\nMohammad\\'s work was presented at the 55th Venice Biennale in 2013, which was the first time Kuwait participated in the event. He has written a book about his work and career, entitled The Art of Sami Mohammad, which was published in 1995.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and education\\r\\nMohammad was born in Kuwait on October 1, 1943. His father was a tailor. As a child, he liked playing with clay and made forms that looked like birds and animals and sold them to his friends. When he was a student at Sabaah School, he helped in creating statues for a school project for commemorating the battle of Port Said and Port Fouad. At the inauguration of the display, he was awarded first prize by Sheikh Abdullah Al Jaber Al Sabah, the General Director of education department.\\r\\nWhen Mohammad was of 20 years, he left the school to start working at the Ministry of Interior. At the same time, The Free Atelier was formed, that provided art material and tutoring free of charge to the students. The Ministry of Education, which officially administers the Atelier as one of its institutional units, granted him a lifelong stipend. As a stipendiary he acquired studio space at The Free Atelier. He joined the Atelier and went to the Atelier regularly. During those years, he read avidly about the works of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, which influenced the early works in his career.\\r\\nIn 1966, he received a government scholarship to Egypt to study at the College of Fine Arts in Cairo, a college of fine arts and completed his degree in 1970. In 1967, he co-founded the Kuwaiti Society of Formative Artists. In 1973, Mohammad got a scholarship for a course of study in the USA to study at the College of Fine Arts in San Francisco. He spent his first year at the Vermont college to improve his English language. Following the course at Vermont, instead of joining College of Fine Arts, he went to Johnson Institute for artists in Princeton. It was at this institute that he started working with bronze casting and other mediums and techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nBefore leaving for the USA to study further, The Kuwaiti University deputized him as a visiting artist to teach tutorials in visual arts. While Mohammad was in the USA, he start working on his first major collection called Curves. After completing his education, he returned to Kuwait in 1976. On his return, he started working on Before birth, \"After birth\" and \"Motherhood\". In 1978, he was selected to represent Kuwait at the Kuwaiti Artists Exhibition in Paris and later represented Kuwait at the Tenth International Sculpture conference held in Toronto. Upon returning from the conference, he began work on his Box series and subsequently started focusing on mankind and humans as the subject of his sculptures and arts.\\r\\nHe held his first travelling exhibition in 1994, which included both paintings and sculptures. The exhibition opened in Sharjah, organized by Department of Culture and Information, Directorate of Arts, then moved to Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Italy and participated in Bodova International Biennial on sculpture. Mohammad closed his studio at The Free Atelier in 1999.\\r\\nThe National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters commissioned him to design the State of Kuwait Merit Award Trophy and was later commissioned to design and execute the golden medal and trophy of The National Achievement Award. In the early 2000s, The Museum of Contemporary Art in Sharjah dedicated a separate wing for his artworks which are exhibited on long-term basis.\\r\\nMohammad\\'s work was presented at 55th Venice Biennale in 2013, the first time that Kuwait participated in the event. Titled \"National Works\" and curated by Ala Younis, the pavilion\\'s show featured a bronze bust of Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, a fiberglass copy of the extended arm of Sheikh Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah (1989), in addition to series of drawings and photographs excavated from the Mohammad\\'s studio. Both works were references produced for unique pieces produced by the artist in previous commissions in 1971 and 1988 respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nThe subject of most of Mohammad\\'s work has been human and Arab revolution. In the beginning of his career, he was involved in making life-size sculptures. Some of the important ones included Ibn Rushd (1964) and Al-Khalil Bin Ahmad (1965). Mohammad often made sculptures that were related to the crisis of the time. In 1983, he made Sabra and Shatila, expressing the pain of Sabra and Shatila massacre and before that he made sculptures relating to the Crisis in the Cairo in 1970\\'s.\\r\\nHe started working on Boxes series, in 1979, which became one of his major works. Other important works by him included the Shackled series, which were paintings and drawings in Chinese ink on paper and the Call for Help series, The Sailor (1964) and Mother\\r\\n(1968). After returning from the US, his art changed considerably, having been influenced by the Western artist. Upon returning from the US, he started studying other artists\\' work and sought to find new ways of expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nSabra and Shatila\\r\\nSabra and Shatila is a sculpture made by Mohammad in 1983 after the Sabra and Shatila massacres. It was the subject of a paper written by Zahra Hussein in 2010. The sculpture shows a man on a block who is blindfolded and appears to be writhing in pain. Hussein wrote in her paper that \"his form is simple yet highly polysemous. In Sabra and Shatila, the barely alive single, recumbent body bound by incising, torturous fetters stands for a people. Mohammad\\'s Sabra and Shatila does what the media images and abstract art regularly decline to do. It Solemnizes its narrative dimension, merges the secular and the sacred and engages in the critique of Political Darwinism.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStatue of Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah\\r\\nMohammad was commissioned by Al-Aam Newspaper in 1971 to make a statue of Sheikh Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah, who was the ruler of Kuwait from 1950 to 1965. The statues was made of Bronze and completed in 1972. While discussing, Mohammad\\'s work, Arab Times wrote that \"the pose the artist chose for his creation and the expression on the face of the Amir reveals the noble bearing of the man he was...\" and called it \"one of the most important works\" by Mohammad. Later, Mohammad also made the statue of Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah. Both these statues were presented at 55th Venice Biennale.\\r\\n\\r\\nHunger\\r\\nIn 1970, Mohmmad made Hunger, which is a sculpture that shows a mother and a child, all skin and bones. The sculpture was modelled of synthetic marble. It was called the \"true epitome of hunger and starving humanity\" by the Arab Times.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtistry and style\\r\\nThe subject of majority of work by Mohammad has been humans and the Arab revolution. The topics for his sculptures surround the ideas of oppression, genocide and suffering. He has made many sculptures that were about the tragedies of his time: the tragedy of Sabra and Chatila, political oppression, economic difficulties and human aggressiveness. An article published in Al-Watan in 1985 wrote than \"Sami has always been faithful to the subjects of his sculpting: humanity and the Arab revolutionary. In this, he is considered a follower of Iraqi school of art sculpture. However, in his style, he belongs to the gulf school. Nevertheless, he has maintained his own steady and prevailing style.\"\\r\\nHis art has been influenced by the Arab awakening of the 70\\'s and the liberalism that came about subsequently. A paper analysing, the work of Mohammad wrote that \"in his early career, Mohammad enjoyed the benefits of the Arab awakenings liberalism and sculpted life size male and female figures in nude, seminude categories. Later, in his mature years, he witnessed the dwindling support for art when less liberal ideologies ascended politically and the exuberant culture climate, brought about by the ideals of Arab awakening and Arab nationals, waned.\" After returning from the US, his art changed considerably, having been influenced by the Western artist. Upon returning from the US, he started studying other artists\\' work and sought to find new ways of expression.\\r\\nFreedom is yet another important concept in the art of Mohammad. A paper about his art discussed that \"...his visual art suggests that the sign of the buoyancy of culture is the conviction that the underpinning logos should be freedom–and most specifically, free speech...\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPublications\\r\\nIn 1995, Mohammad published his first and only book, The Art of Sami Mohammad, a bilingual Arabic-English book which traces the development of his career.\\r\\nMohammad has also been the subject of multiple publications. In 2004, Sami Mohammad and the Semiotics of Abstraction was published that discussed his artwork and style in great detail. In 2010, a paper entitled Aesthetics of Memorialization: The Sabra and Shatila Genocide in the Work of Sami Mohammad, Jean Genet, And June Jordan discussed his Sabra and Shatila. His work was the subject of The Prometheus Myth in the Sculptures of Sami Mohammad and the Plays of Aeschylus and Shelley, a paper published in 2012, that explored semiosis in four of his works Paralysis and Resistance (1980), The Challenge (1983), The Tied Man (1989), and The Earthquake (1990).\\r\\nHe was interviewed by Selections Magazine and was published in their Winter 2018 issues titled \"Sanctuaries\". In this, he talks about his studio and artist life along with his influences.\\r\\n\\r\\nReception\\r\\nMohammad\\'s work has received critical acclaim in Kuwait as well as internationally. His work has received considerable media attention. In a series of articles about Mohammad\\'s life, the Arab Times wrote that \"Sami is an artist deeply involved in the human saga. Everything that spells tragedy and suffering interests him.\"\\r\\nIn September 1987, the Al-Arabi Magazine while reviewing his work wrote that, \"one of the most important elements that gave the formative works of Sami Mohammad a considerable degree of steadiness and strength is his full commitment to the creation of visual and intellectual connection between one artistic step and other.\" Mohammad has often been called one of the most important artists in Kuwait. The Al-Quds Al-Arabi called him \"the most prominent aspect in formative art in Kuwait and the Arab world.\" The Kul al-Arab called his work \"noisily eloquent\" and \"his sculptures are the result of a deep understanding of the feeling and suffering of the viewer\". Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, has said \"his works are worthy of being displayed in the lobbies and corridors of the United Nations Building in New York and of the UNESCO in Paris.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected awards and honors\\r\\n1984 – First prize in First Cairo Art Biennial\\r\\n1988 – First prize at the Kuwait General Exhibition\\r\\n1988 – First prize at the Gulf Corporation Council (GCC) Art Biennial\\r\\nState of Kuwait National Merit Award, given by the National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nOfficial Website', 'Leopold Kessler (1864�1944) was an engineer, newspaper publisher and Zionist. He was instrumental in building many of the institutions that supported the establishment of Israel as a Jewish state.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nLeopold Kessler was born on 4 February 1864, into a family that had been settled for some 250 years in Gliwice, Upper Silesia: then part of Prussia, now part of Poland. He was the youngest of five children of Jacob Kessler and Johanna Feig. His maternal grandfather was Jacob Feig, one of the first Jews permitted to settle in nearby Tarnowitz.\\r\\nKessler studied at the Mining Academy in Freiberg and joined the German Student Corps\\' Teutonia chapter. However, he left because of anti-Semitism and because he did not agree with his fellow members\\' drinking and brawling. He spent a year at the Royal School of Mines in Berlin before returning to Freiberg to complete his studies. Afterward, he left Germany, because he no longer wanted to live in a country where Jews were treated as second-class citizens.\\r\\nKessler became a mining engineer in Rhodesia before going in 1896 to the Transvaal to become general manager of a mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nIntroduction to Zionism\\r\\nKessler wrote in his unfinished autobiography that when he read the booklet \"The Jewish State\" by Theodor Herzl, he felt he had discovered the solution to the problems that had troubled him in his student days. From then on, he declared himself to be a Zionist and became one of the earliest Zionist pioneers in South Africa. In 1899, he became president of the Transvaal Zionist Association and went to Basel, Switzerland, for the first time. He caused a stir at the Third Zionist Congress, where Jews from all over the world had rallied to Herzl�s call. Kessler was \"greeted with enthusiastic applause\" after presenting practical ideas for the Congress\\'s Finance Commission, and was elected a member of the Greater Actions Committee.\\r\\nIn 1900, he made an exploratory trip to Palestine, where he stayed for several months, looking at the geographical, agricultural, and political conditions of the area. He prepared a detailed report for Herzl on the prospects of discovering natural resources such as coal and oil. He suggested publishing an Arabic newspaper and argued that Herzl should petition the Turks to remove the obstacles preventing Jewish immigration to Palestine. Kessler declared that \"optimism, Jewish energy, endurance and intellect, combined with a steady immigration into the country, would lead to the factual recognition of the historical claims of the Jews to Palestine\". Herzl, however, was of the opinion that mass migration should only occur once a charter had been agreed upon.\\r\\nKessler settled in London and attended the Fifth Zionist Congress in 1901. There, he was appointed secretary and became a member of the Colonization Commission. By this time, Herzl regarded Kessler as a friend and counsellor. When Herzl outlined his plan for obtaining a charter from the Turkish sultan, which required the financial and moral support of Cecil Rhodes of South Africa, Kessler offered to secure that support. However, Rhodes died soon afterward, in March 1902.\\r\\n\\r\\nEl Arish proposal\\r\\nIn October 1902, Herzl met with the British colonial secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, and England tentatively offered El Arish in the Sinai Peninsula for Jewish colonisation. This would lead, years later, to the Balfour Declaration. During the negotiations, Herzl had Kessler in mind to participate in the expedition. Oskar Marmorek, an Austro-Hungarian Zionist, appealed to Kessler: \"I know of no-one who could equal you and your knowledge for our expedition. It is therefore your duty, as a loyal comrade, to make the almost impossible, possible.\"\\r\\nHerzl received a document about El Arish from the British foreign secretary, Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, and noted in his diary that it suggested Marmorek, an architect; Kessler, an engineer; and Otto Warburg, an agricultural expert, for the expedition. Petty-Fitzmaurice wrote that in Kessler, he saw a \"coolness and calmness\" he admired, and that \"because of his composure, I like Kessler very well as the leader\" of the expedition. Herzl instructed Kessler to return with a report on the feasibility of settling El Arish. With that report, he hoped to obtain the charter.\\r\\nIn a letter dated 28 January 1902 Herzl authorised Kessler�s leadership of the expedition and laid out his role and responsibilities. Other members of the expedition included Selig Soskin, an agricultural expert, and Hillel Yaffe, a physician to the Jewish colonies in Palestine. Kessler had become friendly with these men during his visit to Palestine in 1900. Also on the team were Marmorek; Albert Goldsmid, a colonel who had taken over Baron Maurice de Hirsch�s Jewish colonies in Argentina in 1892�93; Emile Laurent, a professor at the Agricultural Institute at Gembloux; H. Stephens, an engineer, to investigate water problems; and a representative of the Egyptian government. Kessler himself was chief of the expedition, treasurer, and geological expert.\\r\\nThe team toured the area from 11 February to 25 March 1903. The report signed by Kessler and the other members concluded that the project depended on water supply and, therefore, that the Egyptian government should give permission to divert some water from the Nile. The Egyptian government, calculating that the plan would require five times the amount of water Stephens had estimated, turned down the proposal. Kessler, in a supplementary report, stressed that colonisation could be carried out without Nile waters (by damming wadis, sinking wells, etc.), and Stephens reiterated his calculations with fresh evidence, but permission was once more refused. Kessler and Goldsmid then pursued futile political discussions with Egypt.\\r\\n\\r\\nUganda proposal\\r\\nAfter the El Arish plan failed, the British government offered Uganda for Jewish colonisation. There was enthusiasm for the proposal at the Sixth Zionist Congress, which voted by a large margin to set up a commission to investigate the possibilities of the territory. Kessler led the nine elected members of the commission, including Warburg, Joseph Cowen, L.J. Greenberg, and Chaim Weizmann. On 27 September 1903 he wrote to Herzl that he considered it almost \"hopeless to attempt to establish a purely European colony in the heart of Africa\".\\r\\nKessler�s correspondence with Herzl and Warburg shows that Kessler was convinced that without Jewish enthusiasm, it would be impossible to establish a Jewish state in East Africa. For that reason, he argued that the project should be handed over to the Jewish Colonisation Association (founded by Maurice de Hirsch), whilst the Zionist Organisation should concentrate only on Palestine.\\r\\nHerzl�s death and the heated debate about Uganda delayed the departure of the expedition until December 1904. As Kessler had predicted, the report was discouraging, and the 7th Zionist Congress in 1905 turned down any colonisation site but Palestine.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnglish Zionist Federation\\r\\nAt the Ninth Zionist Congress in 1909, Weizmann and others attempted to depose David Wolffsohn as president of the Zionist Organization. Kessler thanked Wolffsohn for his dedication and proposed a vote of confidence in him. The opposition promptly brought forward a motion of censure, but Kessler�s proposal was accepted by an overwhelming majority.\\r\\nIn 1910, the English Zionist Federation (EZF) was leaderless and on the verge of disintegration. In February 1912, Kessler became its president because he was not personally involved in the controversies surrounding its leadership. He opened the EZF\\'s conference on 1 June 1913 by welcoming the appointment of a new chief rabbi, Joseph Hertz, an old friend of Kessler\\'s from South Africa. At the request of Kessler and other delegates, Cowen accepted the presidency. Kessler remained on the executive committee. On 11 February 1917 Weizmann was elected president of the EZF, and Cowen joined Kessler on the executive committee.\\r\\nIn 1918, the EZF published a 20-page brochure, \"History and Development of Jewish Colonisation in Palestine\", written by Kessler. He wrote that a Jewish Palestine with a population drawn from all countries would be \"the ideal which all nations profess to have made their own\".\\r\\n\\r\\nOther activities\\r\\nWhen L.J. Greenberg decided, with some friends, to acquire The Jewish Chronicle, Kessler provided most of the funding. The acquisition changed the direction of the newspaper, which had been anti-Zionist but became very supportive of the cause. Kessler became director and later chairman of the board. The newspaper\\'s support for Zionism was helpful in the 1917 battle to obtain the Balfour Declaration.\\r\\nKessler was present at the birth of the Jewish National Fund and became its chairman. He was elected to the board of the Jewish Colonial Trust, which became Bank Leumi, as early as 1903, and remained a member of its directorate for almost 20 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal years and legacy\\r\\nAt the end of his life, Kessler lived in New York City. He died on 3 January 1944 without seeing the realisation of his life\\'s work; Israel was established a little over four years after his death.\\r\\nDespite the influence Kessler had on the creation of the modern state of Israel, no street in Israel bears his name. However, a girls\\' school built in 1969 in Lod was named in his honour.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nSources\\r\\nZionist Central Archives, Jerusalem\\r\\n\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nKessler, Leopold.

After graduating from seminary in 1904, he enrolled in the Faculty of Physics and Medicine of the University of Yuryev (today University of Tartu), but a year later the Russian Revolution of 1905 broke out and he was forced to quit university. Back in Kishinev, he became involved with young Romanian intellectuals, working on Revista Basarabia, the first Romanian-language publication in Bessarabia in that period. In its pages he printed the revolutionary hymn \"Deșteaptă-te, române!\", which caused the Tsarist authorities to seek his arrest.\\r\\nTaking refuge in Iași, he enrolled in the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy of the University of Iași, where he took classes from 1908 to 1912. At this time he worked on the magazine Viața românească, in which he published \"Scrisori din Basarabia\" (\"Letters from Bessarabia\"). In 1908, he published Pilde și novele (\"Proverbs and Novels\") in Chișinău (using Cyrillic), the first Bessarabian fiction novel, while in 1912 \"Basarabia, schiță geografică\" (\"Bessarabia, Geographic Sketch\") appeared. Returning to Chișinău in 1913, he published, together with Nicolae Alexandri and with the assistance of Vasile Stroescu, the newspaper Cuvânt moldovenesc, which he directed after April 1917. He wrote unceasingly in favour of union with Romania.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical activity\\r\\nHalippa\\'s political activity intensified as the 1910s wore on and in 1917 he founded the Moldovan National Party. The year 1918 found him at the head of the unionist wave, for which he was elected first vice-president, then president of Sfatul Țării, the assembly which voted for the union of Bessarabia with Romania on 27 March 1918. He also took parts in the assemblies at Cernăuți and Alba Iulia (Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia), where, respectively, the acts of union of Bukovina and Transylvania with Romania were proclaimed.\\r\\nAfter 1918 he held a number of government posts: Minister and Secretary of State for Bessarabia (1919–1920), Minister of Public Works (1927), Minister of Public Works and Communications (1930) interim Minister of Work, Health and Social Protection (1930), Minister Secretary of State (1928–1930, 1932, 1932–1933), senator and deputy in parliament (1918–1934). He was a member of the National Peasants\\' Party after its founding in 1926.\\r\\nThroughout his time in office, Halippa sought to further Bessarabia\\'s cultural development. He founded the Chișinău Popular University (1917), the Moldovan Conservatory, the Society of Bessarabian Writers and Journalists and the Luceafărul Editorial Society and Bookstore in Chișinău (1940). In 1932 he edited and headed the magazine Viața Basarabiei (\"Bessarabian Life\") and the eponymous daily newspaper. In 1918 Halippa was chosen corresponding member of the Romanian Academy; removed in 1948, he was restored to its ranks posthumously in 1990.\\r\\nIn 1950 he was arrested and imprisoned without trial at Sighet prison, in Sighetu Marmației. Two years later he was handed over to the NKVD, taken to Chișinău, tried and sentenced to 25 years\\' hard labour in Siberia.

He is renowned as a writer of realist novels, especially those set around sugar-cane, and highlighted the abuse to which sugar industry workers were subject. On July 17, 1959, he was assassinated on orders of generalissimo Rafael Trujillo.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and education\\r\\nRamón Marrero Aristy Beltré was born in the town of San Rafael del Yuma, La Altagracia Province, Dominican Republic to Juan Bautista Aristy Marrero and Olivia Beltré on 14 June 1912. His family was quite affluent and so he spent his early years living a comfortable life in the countryside; however, due to the American Occupation of the Dominican Republic from 1916-1924 he went into exile with his parents. His years in exile were spent in: Colombia, Venezuela and the Dutch Antilles. Finally in 1922 he returned along with his parents to the Dominican Republic.\\r\\nUpon their return the Aristy family were unable to once again establish themselves in their lands in the east of the country; instead they settled in the south western part of the country. Up till the year 1929 the Aristy family was lived in their south western holdings and went through rough times attempting to rebuild their destroyed fortune. Nevertheless, Ramón Marrero Aristy was able to find time for his education.\\r\\nIn 1928, at age 16 Marrero Aristy was a correspondent for two Dominican newspapers: 'El Diario' (Santiago de los Caballeros and 'El Nuevo Diario' (Santo Domingo) in addition to working at a laundry.\\r\\nThe remaining part of his adolescence was spent in the Eastern town of La Romana where he continued his education and worked at the Central Romana Corporation's food warehouse. While working at the warehouse he was a first-hand witness to the abuses the predominantly Haitian sugar labourers were subjected to.\\r\\nHe left the Central Romana's warehouse and moved to the capital, Santo Domingo where he graduated from secondary school and entered the University of Santo Domingo (now Autonomous University of Santo Domingo) pursuing a degree in journalism. He left the university without graduating but became a frequent writer in nationwide newspapers such as: Listín Diario, El Caribe and La Nación.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterary career\\r\\nThree years after moving to Santo Domingo, in 1938 Marrero Aristy published his first book, Balsié. One year later, he published the novel Over in which he detailed what he had witnessed while working at the Central Romana warehouse, especially how the sugar labourers were forced to over-pay for their food products (hence the title.)\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical career\\r\\nIn his youth, he became interested in socialism. He wrote for many newspapers including Listín Diario, El Radical, El Novel, El Tiempo, La Actualidad, La Avispa, La Opinión, and La Nación, of which he was director as well as for the journal Babeque. Described as an underground marxist dissident, communist, and romantic marxist, he was involved in the few existing clandestine resistance groups left, up until the end of the 1930s, when he decided to serve in Trujillo’s regime in 1940, after Manuel Arturo Peña Batlle, another important dissident intellectual, accepted a position in the government. Marrero Aristy served in many important official positions thereafter.\\r\\nIn 1946 he won the trust of the dictator when he acted as mediator of the agreement signed between Trujillo and the Cuban and Dominican communists, which allowed certain civil liberties and the formation of the Popular Socialist Party. From this, Trujillo commissioned him in 1954 to write the official Dominican history.\\r\\nHe was a Deputy to the National Congress in the periods of 1948–1950 for Azua, from 1950 to 1952 for El Seibo and from 1954 to 1957 for Santo Domingo. He was Secretary of State for Labor from 1957 to 1959 and represented the Dominican Government in diplomatic missions. In 1957, as Secretary of Labor, he wrote a confidential report to Trujillo informing him of the exploitation of the coffee workers.\\r\\nHis last liberal performance, to which his murder is attributed, were the statements he offered to the journalist Tad Szulc, of the New York Times, denouncing the existing corruption in the government, provoking the wrath of the tyrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath\\r\\nHe was assassinated on July 17, 1959, in the National Palace and transferred along with his assassinated driver, Luis Concepción, to the Cazabito hill, Constanza, to fake a car accident.\\r\\nTrujillo held him responsible for the content of an article published on July 12, 1959, in The New York Times, in which his government was accused of being corrupt. A week later, his body was found charred inside his car on a cliff on the Santo Domingo-Constanza highway. He died on July 17 at the age of 47.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==\", 'Pedro Carujo (1801–1836) was a Venezuelan military officer. He was one of the leaders in the Revolution of the Reforms of 1835.\\r\\n\\r\\nYouth\\r\\nHe was the son of Canarian José Carujo, royalist official and Venezuelan Juana Hernandez. He received a good education, being one of the few Venezuelans of his time who spoke and wrote English and French. Although born in a home divided over the Royalist and Republican causes, he joined the liberation movement as part of the battalion Orinoco quartered in Angostura (1819). In 1821, he participated under the command of General José Francisco Bermúdez, in the campaigns of Caracas and St. Lucia. With the rank of captain, he distinguished himself in Maracaibo (1823), but was wounded in combat, so he moved to New Granada with the rank of sergeant.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Granada\\r\\nHe studied mathematics and analytical geometry under the leadership of the Franciscan friar Tomás Sánchez Mora, and he joined the Freemasons. In 1828, while serving as a General Staff assistant of the department of Cundinamarca, he was promoted to commander and was selected by Simon Bolivar to chair the Military Academy that was founded in Bogotá. In spite of this, he joined the opponents of President Simón Bolívar, who perpetrated the attacks of September 25, 1828 against the Liberator\\'s life.\\r\\nHe was sentenced to death but was saved thanks to a pardon granted by the Council of Ministers, with intervention from Rafael Urdaneta. He was locked in a prison in Bogota, and was then imprisoned in the Boca Chica Castle, Cartagena. In March 1829, he was transferred to Solano castle overlooking Puerto Cabello from which he escaped (8/2/1829). However, he was captured soon after and was returned to the fort in a humiliating way.\\r\\nHis time spent in prison advocating for freedom, writing to the general José Antonio Páez and other officials of the regime; to publishing articles and letters in El Fanal newspaper. He was deported to Curaçao in early June 1830, and the general amnesty decreed by Paez 25 in the same month allowed him to return to Venezuela. He went to Maracaibo and organized a militia of 1,000 men, with whom he crossed the border and ventured to Riohacha, who had rebelled against the government of Rafael Urdaneta. In January 1831, in the vicinity of San José and the Mill, he was defeated by the general Jose Felix Blanco, after which he would retire from the army in 1833. Subsequently, he became the spokesman for a group of military and ranchers gathered around the general Santiago Mariño. Carujo fought from the columns of the El republicano newspaper against the presidential candidacy of Dr. José María Vargas, whom he accused of being \"realistic and unpatriotic\" (1834).\\r\\n\\r\\nRevolution and death\\r\\nIn 1835, he was one of the officers who led the Revolution of the Reforms, led by General Santiago Mariño, and was in charge of capturing President Vargas at home (08/07/1835).  There was a dialogue between them, whereby Carujo told Vargas: \"Doctor Vargas, the world belongs to the brave\", who in turn replied: \"the world is for the just man\", after which he went into exile on the island of Saint Thomas.\\r\\nIn charge in the Anzoátegui battalion, Carujo was one of the most militant participants in that civil war, winning the battles of Cariaco (September 20, 1835) and Carúpano (10/5/1835), where he defeated the general Francisco Esteban Gomez. The army left Puerto Cabello, won in El Pino, near San Esteban National Park (October 27, 1835), against the colonel Andrés Torellas and three of their brigades. They attempted to take Valencia on October 28 and were defeated the next day in the battle of Camoruco, by general José María Carreño. Although he was locked in the San Felipe Castle, Carujo managed to escape and restart incursions into Tucacas, Aroa and San Felipe. Finally, wounded and captured at the Battle of Paso Real, near Puerto Cabello (December 25, 1835), he was tried and sentenced to death (January 27, 1836), but the sentence was not fulfilled, and he died in prison in Valencia, as a result of injuries sustained during the development of what would be his last fight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Armin Medosch (1962�2017) was an Austrian artist, curator, theorist and critic working in the fields of net.art, new media art and DiY networking.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nMedosch was born in Graz.

She was portrayed by Barbara Crampton, who departed from the role in 1993. Crampton returned from 1998 to 2002 and again from 2006 to 2007. In March 2023, Crampton returned to the show to celebrate the show’s 50th Anniversary.\\r\\nMuch of Leanna\\'s history revolves around her marriage to Victor Newman.\\r\\n\\r\\nCreation\\r\\nCasting\\r\\nBarbara Crampton was the only actress to play Leanna. She previously had roles in soaps such as Days of Our Lives and Guiding Light. During an interview with Daily Grind House Crampton stated: \"When it first started, that role was only supposed to be for three months. Then they cast me in it, and after two months they said, \\'You know, it\\'s kind of working. We’d like to keep your character for another year.\\' So I said OK and I worked on it for a year.  Then they said, \\'You know, it’s really working. We want to hire you on for another three years.\\' I did it for another three years, and then I did it for another two or three years after that. She had a good long run for somebody who wasn’t married and in a family on a soap opera.\" Crampton said there is always a possibility for Leanna to make another guest appearance.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacterization\\r\\nBorn as Leanna Randolphe, she is known as \"the unscrupulous reporter who penned Ruthless, a scandalous exposé about Victor Newman\".\\r\\nDue to Leanna\\'s psychotic personality, Crampton did some research in order to properly portray the character: \"I had to do some investigating about what types of personality disorders she could have to make this character interesting, and I talked to a lot of psychiatrists about it.  I came up with a personality profile for her that I played,\" she stated during an interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nStorylines\\r\\n1987–93\\r\\nAshley Abbott had a nervous breakdown after having an abortion, ran off to New York City, and lost her memory after she was mugged. She ended up at a mental hospital where Dr. Steven Lassiter was her psychiatrist. Her father, John, eventually found her in New York and returned her to a posh private institution near Genoa City. Stephen had fallen in love with Ashley, followed, and became a resident psychiatrist there. Ashley recovered thanks to Steven\\'s devotion, and they were married. During their honeymoon in Hawaii, they were stalked by Leanna Randolphe, a former mental patient of Stephen\\'s who fantasized that they were lovers. After Leanna made several attempts to murder Ashley with a poisoned lei, Ashley spent most of her honeymoon sick. Ashley never found out about Leanna\\'s connection to Stephen nor that she tried to murder her.\\r\\nLeanna followed them back to Genoa City and abandoned her obsession with Stephen once she got involved with Jack Abbott, who arranged for her to write a sensational tell-all biography, under the pseudonym of Nora Randall called Ruthless: The Victor Newman Story, which would expose and destroy Victor. Ironically, Victor also hired her to write an authorized biography of his life. Without Jack\\'s consent, or knowledge, Leanna added an extra chapter to Ruthless that chronicled Ashley\\'s ill-fated affair with Victor, including details about her abortion and nervous breakdown. Victor was outraged, assumed his estranged wife Nikki Newman had been behind the exposé, and divorced her. In his anger, and still unaware that Leanna had written Ruthless, Victor took Leanna with him in his private jet and they marry in Las Vegas in October 1988. In February 1989, Nikki shocks the newly weds by revealing their marriage is invalid because Victor and Nikki\\'s divorce isn\\'t finalized. Despite the failed marriage, Victor and Leanna stay together.\\r\\nOn her own, Leanna used her wiles to land a job as an advice columnist for the lovelorn at a publication owned by Victor using the pen name \"Leanna Love\". Because Leanna felt guilty about Ruthless, and had come to genuinely care for Victor, she wrote another book called \"Victor Newman - Man and Myth\", using her real name, Leanna Randolphe. When Victor learned that Leanna and Jack Abbott had been lovers, he realized Leanna had written Ruthless. Victor publicly fired her from his company and sold the publication, then divorced Leanna, and remarried Nikki. Victor devised a plan to punish Jack by orchestrating a takeover of Jabot, displaced Jack, and made Brad Carlton his superior. \\r\\nWith the help of long-time admirer and friend of Victor, Douglas Austin, Leanna created the \"I Hate Men Campaign\" rallying wronged women everywhere. By a year later, Leanna had forgotten about being a man-hater and competed with Jill Foster Abbott for Rex Sterling, then again for John Abbott a year after that.\\r\\nLeanna\\'s notoriety landed her a nationally syndicated gossip talk show on television called the Leanna Love Show, and she has since made infrequent stops to Genoa City whenever juicy gossip concerning Victor is to be had.\\r\\n\\r\\n1998–2002\\r\\nIn 1998, Victor was involved in a bitter divorce from Diane Jenkins. Diane\\'s scheming attorney, Michael Baldwin, arranged for her to appear on Leanna\\'s talk show, The Leanna Love Show, to gain public sympathy for her at the settlement hearing. Leanna, still bitter over the ill treatment she had received from Victor, was happy to oblige. When Victor tuned in to the show he was outraged that Diane had exposed his personal life on national television. Victor suffered major business setbacks after Diane\\'s appearance on the show. As damage control and to expedite the divorce, Victor gave in to all of Diane\\'s settlement demands.\\r\\nLater, as revenge, Victor purchased Westmark Media, the company that owned Leanna\\'s show, and fired Leanna and cancelled her show.\\r\\n\\r\\n2006–07\\r\\nIn 2006, Leanna, now a journalist, returned to Genoa City to interview Ashley, who was being charged with the murder of Tom Fisher (Roscoe Born).

It is based in Washington, D.C., and the membership consists primarily of journalists, students, educators, and communications professionals. The organization was previously known as the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association (NLGJA), but changed its name in 2013 to \"NLGJA: The Association of LGBT Journalists\" to reflect the diversity of the communities it represents. In 2016, it added a \"Q\" to represent queer journalists and people, updating its name to \"NLGJA: The Association of LGBTQ Journalists\". In 2023, it added a \"+\" to represent those gender-diverse and sex-diverse people whose identities are not well-known to be added to the acronym, and those who are questioning their identities, updating its name to \"NLGJA: The Association of LGBTQ+ Journalists\".\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nThe association was founded by Roy Aarons in 1990, along with other journalists, Elaine Herscher, Shannon Hickey, David Tuller, Victor Zonana, and Kathleen Buckley, who made up its first board.\\r\\nJen Christensen took over as NLGJA national president following the death of Michael Triplett, who died January 18, 2013, less than six month after his election.\\r\\nThe association has inspired the founding of the French association of LGBTQ journalists in 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nContributions to journalism\\r\\nPress service\\r\\nIn connection with Witeck-Combs Communications, the NLGJA launched OutNewsWire in 2008 to simplify the distribution of news articles relating to the LGBTQ community.  The wire has more than 400 journalists receiving updates currently, which are available online.  The service comes at a discounted price to \"nonprofits hoping to use the service to reach the LGBTQ media\".\\r\\n\\r\\nNewsroom Outreach Project\\r\\nAs early as 1996, the NLGJA, along with Hollywood Supports, developed “sexual orientation in the workplace” seminars that were conducted in Knight Ridder newspapers across on the nation.  The seminars were designed to place emphasis on acceptance in the workplace, through discussions of stereotypes and business and legal issues involved with the LGBTQ community.  The stated goal of these seminars was to provide an LGBTQ-friendly office environment for LGBTQ journalists, but the discussions also pushed for domestic partnership benefits at newspapers across the nation, one of the main focuses of the LGBTQ rights movement nationwide. The seminars are offered free of charge to news organizations.\\r\\nDuring the seminars, facilitators introduce employees to the “model of parity” NLGJA developed in order to encourage equality and inclusiveness within the workplace.  There are fourteen steps in this model, highlighting both workplace climate and fair compensation.  Included in these steps are things like avoiding double standards, promoting balanced coverage, providing the same insurance coverage for all employees, and offering family and medical leave.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nNational Gay Newspaper Guild\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nNLGJA Homepage\\r\\nRe:Act to your news blog - the official blog of NLGJA\\r\\nNLGJA Student Central', \"Vincentas Jakševičius (c.\\u20091873 in Naujamiestis district, Russian Empire – July 19, 1936 in Kaišiadorys, Lithuania) was a Lithuanian sculptor specializing in church interiors.

His father was a carpenter and sculptor, progenitor of three generations of artists. Jakševičius' family moved to Panevėžys in ca 1887 where three youngest Vincentas' siblings were born. Jakševičius married a noble woman in 1897 and had a large family. However, out of seven of his children, three died in infancy or early childhood.\\r\\nJakševičius' talent for art was recognized at early age. According to family history, as a teenager, he carved a portrait of Tsar Alexander III of Russia which earned him free education in Vilnius and Saint Petersburg. Jakševičius moved around frequently, but settled in Švėkšna where he built a family house around 1920 on land gifted to him by the Plater family, owners of Švėkšna Manor.\\r\\nJakševičius worked with his family members, first with his father, then younger brother Benjaminas, and later with sons Silvanas (1900–1933) and Adomas (1908–1967). Working as a team, they were able to undertake larger and more complex projects. Jakševičius was a versatile artists as he could design and implement (sculpt, paint, carve) various projects. He is mostly known for his work in decorating churches: pulpits, altars, furniture (benches, ceremonial seats), sculptures, paintings, wall decor, various decorative elements, etc. He also built grottos of Our Lady of Lourdes (in Veiviržėnai, Ablinga, Gardamas, Dembava, Inkakliai) as well as grave monuments.

It was created by writer Jean Van Hamme and artist William Vance. It is currently being written by Yves Sente and Youri Jigounov. The storyline of the first five volumes was adapted into a video game in 2003, also titled XIII, which was released on several platforms. A Canadian television film based on the series, XIII: The Conspiracy, was released in 2008. It was followed in 2011 by two seasons of a TV series, each 13 episodes, called XIII: The Series.\\r\\n\\r\\nMain characters\\r\\nXIII: The title character suffers from total amnesia. He soon discovers that he is suspected of the assassination of President William Sheridan. Throughout the albums he tries to regain his memory and to find out the true facts surrounding the assassination of the president. Although his memory does not return, he gradually learns more about who he is. His real name is Jason Mullway. However, because he was adopted at a young age (after the death of his mother and the disappearance of his father) by Jonathan MacLane, a cousin of his father Sean Mullway, he officially bears the name Jason MacLane.\\r\\nGeneral Benjamin (Ben) Carrington: He holds a senior military position in the Pentagon. He is convinced that XIII is innocent and he helps him regain his memory.\\r\\nJones: She is Carrington\\'s assistant and she was also trained by him. As a permanent partner, she supports XIII everywhere. She is a skilled pilot, both for airplanes and helicopters. While she is still a lieutenant in the first stories, she has now risen to the rank of colonel.\\r\\nMongoose: XIII\\'s arch-enemy is an assassin who fears nothing. Initially they call him Schreiner, because he is an apprentice to a Berlin carpenter, this is revealed in XIII Mystery: The Mongoose. He was hired by Number I to kill XIII. XIII lost his memory due to a bullet from the Mongoose.\\r\\nColonel Amos: He had to solve the murder of William Sheridan and first suspected XIII, who was able to escape. After it became clear to him that XIII was innocent, he helped him instead of arresting him.\\r\\nWally Sheridan: US President. His brother William was murdered by Steve Rowland on behalf of Number I.\\r\\nBetty Barnowski: a -now former- soldier who met XIII during an undercover mission and who has helped him regularly since then.\\r\\nMarquis De Préseau: an old, friendly French aristocrat who often comes to XIII\\'s aid. Through XIII he met Betty Barnowski, with whom he has been in a relationship ever since.\\r\\nFelicity Brown: a dangerous opportunist who does not shy away from violence to get her way. Rather coincidentally, her path crosses that of XIII several times, and they get in each other\\'s way.\\r\\nStephen G. Dundee: Appears only in the 13th album. It is remarkable that he plays a role in both XIII and another comics series, Largo Winch.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolumes 1-5\\r\\nThe series begins with a amnesiac man awakening to find himself washed ashore in the East Coast. The only clues to his past are a tattoo of the Roman numerals \"XIII\" on his collarbone and a photo of himself with a woman, who is identified as Kim Rowland, widow of US Army captain Steve Rowland. Volumes 1 through 5 deal with \"XIII\" searching for his identity and past. He finds himself hunted by a contract killer, the \"Mongoose\", who works for a mysterious organization known as XX, which aims to mount a coup against the US government. XIII is rescued from XX\\'s assassins by Colonel Amos of the FBI, who confronts XIII with video evidence that shows XIII assassinating the President.\\r\\nIn the second volume, XIII is captured by General Carrington and his aide, Lieutenant Jones. Carrington confirms that XIII is Rowland, and further explains that Rowland was a member of a special operations unit called Special Assault and Destroying Sections (SPADS). Carrington had been commander of SPADS when Rowland was supposedly killed in action two years earlier. Because XIII\\'s amnesia prevents him from identifying who sponsored the President\\'s assassination, Amos lets him go. XIII reunites with his father and his uncle, but they are both murdered by XIII\\'s young, gold-digging stepmother Felicity, who frames him after harming herself. XIII escapes the police with Carrington\\'s help and meets Kim, an XX member known as \"XVII\", who reveals that XIII is not Steve Rowland. XIII is arrested by the police and Kim disappears. XIII is found guilty for the murders and sent to a maximum security prison.\\r\\nThe third volume finds Amos, still pursuing his investigation, realizing that XIII was a body double for the real Steve Rowland. Amos requests Carrington\\'s help to identify people who have been trained as top-level special operators and match XIII\\'s physique; Amos\\'s aim is to discover XIII\\'s true identity. Carrington provides the papers of about twenty people. One, named Ross Tanner, has been missing for two years. Amos decides to leave XIII in prison to have his amnesia treated. The treatment fails, and the Mongoose tries to have XIII killed in the prison. Carrington helps XIII break out.\\r\\nVolume four begins with Amos finding that Carrington had invented the Tanner identity and suspecting him of being part of the conspiracy to kill the President. XIII, under the name of Ross Tanner, has been hidden by Carrington in a SPADS training facility in the fictitious Latin American country of San Miguel. Amos continues to delve into the files and learns that Rowland was murdered shortly after the assassination. Amos now assumes that Rowland was the real assassin, and is confused about XIII\\'s real role, but he exposes Judge Allenby, the head of the investigation, as one of the conspirators. Amos interrogates Allenby, who is killed by the Mongoose\\'s assassin; Amos himself is rescued by Kim. Meanwhile, a female SPADS Sergeant named Betty Barnowsky reveals to XIII that she saw Rowland in Eastown after his alleged death, in the company with SPADS Colonel Seymour McCall. XIII, Barnowsky, and Jones escape an assassination attempt by McCall but end up lost in the San Miguel jungle.\\r\\nKim takes Amos to Carrington and National Intelligence Director Carl Heideger, who reveal that, after faking his death in the helicopter crash, Rowland contacted Kim and forced her to be a member of the conspiracy. Kim, not sharing the conspiracy\\'s ideology, and herself a former secret agent, secretly alerted her former boss, Heideger. Despite having this information, however, Heideger was unable to prevent the assassination of the President. Rowland was shot by the Mongoose, but he escaped, mortally wounded, and died shortly after telling Kim what had happened. Heideger and Carrington then came up with a plan to make XX believe that Rowland had survived, hoping to attract the Mongoose\\'s killers, arrest them, and follow their trail to the conspirators. They sourced a man named Jason Fly who was transformed into a Rowland double, but soon after, Fly disappeared, when he was shot and lost his memory, just before the story began. Kim is also revealed to be Carrington\\'s daughter.\\r\\nAt the start of volume five, XIII, Jones, and Barnowsky kidnap the Marquis de Préseau, a rich French land owner in San Miguel, to steal his jet to fly back to the US. Meanwhile, Carrington and Heideger have been arrested by the conspirators as they prepare to take over the country during a large-scale military exercise. XIII and the women meet with Amos, who brings them into contact with Walter Sheridan, brother of the assassinated President and himself a candidate for presidency.\\r\\nSheridan helps XIII infiltrate the military\\'s center of operations, and, together with President Galbrain, manage to stop the conspiracy at the last moment. The entire conspiracy group, with the exception of the illustrious Number I, has been either killed or captured. Walter is elected President, and Kim remains missing for reasons unknown. At the end of the story, XIII believes he has found his old identity as Jason Fly and is prepared to continue his life normally, even if his memories have not yet returned.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolumes 6-8\\r\\nIn the following volumes, XIII takes up the investigation about his past. Volumes six and seven bring XIII to Greenfalls, a snowy town in the Rocky Mountains, where the story revolves around the fate of his father in the McCarthian 1950s. XIII learns that his father, Jonathan Fly, was murdered by the local Klansmen after they found out Fly\\'s real identity was Jonathan McClane, a \"red\" journalist who had to flee after suffering under McCarthy\\'s witch hunt. The Mongoose still tracks XIII with the blessing of McClane\\'s assassins, but XIII evades the manhunt, gets justice for the murder of his father and manages to arrest the Mongoose, who reveals that he was on Number I\\'s boat when he shot the bullet that made XIII amnesic, but divulges no further information about Number I. The story ends with XIII finally finding his true identity as Jason McClane.\\r\\nIn volume eight, XIII is approached by President Sheridan to become a special agent and is charged with finding Number I. The Mongoose escapes from custody. XIII tracks down Kim, guessing that she stayed in hiding because she knows Number I\\'s identity. He discovers that one of the boats close to the spot where he was found amnesic is Sheridan\\'s yacht. Meanwhile, Jones investigates further and discovers that Kim had a love child with Sheridan. After passing on this information to XIII, they become convinced that Sheridan was in fact Number I, and used the XX to have his brother killed and propel himself to the Presidency. Sheridan had the child kidnapped to force Kim to marry Rowland, to betray Jason when Heideger\\'s plan threatened to expose him as Number I, and have him lured onto his yacht where XIII was shot by the Mongoose. After trying to release Kim from an island where they believe she is sequestered, XIII and Jones, along with Kim, are caught by the Mongoose, who sinks Sheridan\\'s yacht with an explosive. XIII only manages to rescue Jones, and Kim is presumed dead.\\r\\nXIII finally faces Sheridan, who has been exposed as Number I. XIII has no evidence or witness against him, however. Sheridan does not assassinate XIII to avoid a new investigation that might expose him, and XIII and Jones leave the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolumes 9-13\\r\\nIn the following volumes, the action takes place in and around Costa Verde, a small fictional nation in Central America where XIII is led to believe he once led a revolution under the identity of \"El Cascador\", although El Cascador is supposedly dead. XIII gets involved with revolutionary Maria de los Santos, who claims to have been his wife. In the tenth volume, after freeing her from a prison from which she was awaiting execution, she confirms that he is her husband.\\r\\nDuring the revolution, XIII meets an Irish-American expat, Sean Mullway, who claims to be XIII\\'s real father and confirms that XIII is Jason McClane. The history of XIII\\'s Irish descent is revealed, and XIII learns that his mother was the sister of NSA Director Giordino, who accidentally murdered her. The Giordinos are revealed to be a Mafia family. At the end of the volume, XIII is offered amnesty by the US ambassador, who explains that XIII\\'s help is needed; Carrington has apparently gone insane.\\r\\nIn volume twelve, the corrupt President Sheridan is kidnapped by Carrington, who has learned that Sheridan ordered his daughter Kim\\'s death. Carrington and Amos have XIII and Jones capture the Mongoose to get further evidence against Sheridan. In a televised \"trial\", Sheridan is revealed to the American public as Number I, with XIII and the Mongoose testifying. In the aftermath of the event, Sheridan kills the Mongoose, and Giordino accidentally kills Sheridan.\\r\\nVolume thirteen, The XIII Mystery: The Investigation, is a special issue, where two journalists retrace the first twelve issues, clarifying and expanding the storyline.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolumes 14-20\\r\\nWhile in exile in Costa Verde, XIII and Mullway attempt to find a treasure hidden by their ancestors somewhere in Mexico. Giordino, meanwhile, fabricates evidence claiming that XIII is Seamus O\\'Neill, an IRA operative who trained under Fidel Castro. As O\\'Neill, XIII is wanted by the US government, but he again manages to escape. He also survives an assassination attempt by Irina Svetlanova, who has taken over the Mongoose\\'s operation. After many setbacks, the treasure is found and then lost again. Meanwhile, Giordino is removed from duty by the new President, who has received evidence from XIII and Mullway revealing that Giordino is not only connected to the Mafia but also that he killed Sheridan.\\r\\nVolumes eighteen and nineteen are the last written by Van Hamme. Volume eighteen, The Irish Version, was drawn by Jean Giraud, otherwise known as Mœbius. It features as a story within the story, and it is referred to as part of the plot along with The XIII Mystery in volume nineteen The Last Round. This is the prequel to the initial story arc, and it resolves all mysteries surrounding XIII\\'s identity.\\r\\nXIII has learned his identity, but his memories still have not returned. He seeks medical treatment to uncover them in volume twenty, but Mayflower Day, a secret organization, schemes to keep XIII from unblocking his memory, because of yet another secret in his past.\\r\\n\\r\\nPopularity\\r\\nXIII was released in 1984 as a serial in the popular Spirou magazine, and it was popular among Spirou readers. The first three episodes were released as a single hardcover volume by Dargaud the same year. This continued for later issues, and, by the time of the eighth issue, Thirteen to One, sales of the hardcover had reached 140,000 copies. Promotion for the series included a special draw by the French national lottery in 2000 with 1,500,000 tickets and a €13,000 grand prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nTranslations\\r\\nXIII was originally written in French, and it was translated into several languages, including English, Dutch, German, Polish, Swedish, Tamil, Serbo-Croatian, and Italian.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolumes\\r\\nIn English\\r\\nIn 1989, XIII was first released in English as Code XIII, but after the first three volumes, publication ended in 1990 when the publisher (Catalan/Comcat) went out of business.\\r\\nIn 2005, Alias Comics started publishing the title as a series of 32-page monthly comics edited for U.S. audiences.

His family returned to Europe in 1890, however, and the Bellonis settled in Lugano, Switzerland. He took an early interest in sculpture, and was mentored by Luis Vasseli, earning a scholarship that briefly took him to Uruguay, in 1899. He later enrolled in the Munich Academy, and participated in numerous exhibitions throughout Europe.\\r\\nReturning to Uruguay, Belloni became an instructor in the Committee for the Encouragement of Fine Arts, and in 1914, he was picked to succeed painter Carlos María Herrera as director of the institution. Belloni created a sculpture in homage to his recently deceased predecessor, and its unveiling later that year in Montevideo's Paseo del Prado created a demand for his works as monuments.\\r\\nThe first of these was Belloni's La carreta (The Carriage), an ode to the ox-cart drivers ubiquitous in the 19th century, cast in Florence, Italy by the Ferdinando Marinelli Artistic Foundry and unveiled in a city park (today José Batlle y Ordoñez Park), in 1919. La música (1923) a monument to William Tell (1931) followed (also cast in Florence by Ferdinando Marinelli's foundry), and Belloni contributed numerous bronzes and bas-reliefs to the General Assembly of Uruguay, as well.\\r\\nThe noted sculptor also taught painting at the University of Montevideo's School of Architecture. Continuing to sculpt in later life, among his well-known works from this period was Nuevos rumbos (New Paths), a naturalist work overlooking Parque Rodó, as well as a monument to the park's namesake, writer and lawmaker José Enrique Rodó. Belloni completed El entrevero (The Struggle) practically upon his death in 1965, at age 83. The masterpiece was placed upon Fabini Plaza, on 18th of July Avenue, in 1967.\\r\\nHis son Stelio was also a notable sculptor.\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\\r\\nRevista Raíces – José Belloni\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==\", 'Enrique Alférez (1901–1999) was a Mexican artist who specialized in sculpting architectural reliefs and the human form.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and education\\r\\nBorn in a rural village in northern Mexico, Alférez was introduced to sculpture by his father, a woodworker who was trained . He ran away at age 12, and was conscripted into the Constitutional Army during the Mexican Revolution. In 1920, he fled his home country and made his way to El Paso, Texas, where he found work as a photographer\\'s assistant. It was here he attended a lecture presented by art teacher Lorado Taft, who was visiting El Paso on an Art Institute of Chicago tour. Seeing potential in the young man, Taft encouraged Alferez to come study under him in Chicago, which he did from 1927 through 1929.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nAfter completing his education in 1929, he moved to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he spent much of the rest of his life. He later married an American woman named Margaret, with whom he had a daughter.\\r\\nHis sculptures and reliefs adorn many parks, buildings, and landmarks in the New Orleans Metropolitan Area, many of them commissioned by the Works Progress Administration. Some of the most notable include those in City Park, as well as the \"Molly Marine\" statue, the first American sculpture to depict a woman in military uniform. His fountain at New Orleans Lakefront Airport is a well known local landmark.  He made reliefs for a number of buildings, including the Charity Hospital Building in New Orleans and the Palmolive Building in Chicago.\\r\\nAlférez was not only a sculptor, and actively produced work in other artistic disciplines. Notably, he painted an official portrait of Senator Huey P. Long (who he personally loathed, as he revealed decades later).\\r\\nAlférez remained active into his later years, both as a working artist and an art teacher.  In 1993, he appeared in a PBS American Experience documentary entitled \"The Hunt for Pancho Villa\".\\r\\nIn the years after Alférez\\'s passing, author Katie Bowler Young began researching his work and went on to publish an extensive biography on his life titled \"Enrique Alférez: Sculptor\" in 2020 through the Historic New Orleans Collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nEnrique Alferez in The Hunt For Pancho Villa\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Ruy Roque Gameiro (27 February 1906 – 18 August 1935) was a Portuguese sculptor.

Amnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience and has called for his immediate and unconditional release. For years, he was the only Swedish citizen held as a prisoner of conscience (he is now joined by kidnapped Swedish citizen and publicist Gui Minhai). As of 2023, he is considered to be one of the world\\'s longest continuously detained journalists.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsylum and Swedish citizenship\\r\\nIsaak came to Sweden in August 1987, where he settled in the west coast city of Gothenburg and became a Swedish citizen on 4 November 1992. When Eritrea gained independence, Isaak returned to his native country, married and had children. He began working as a reporter for the country\\'s first independent newspaper, Setit. Eventually, he became a part-owner of the newspaper.\\r\\n\\r\\nImprisonment\\r\\nOn 23 September 2001, Isaak was arrested in his home in Asmara. At the same time, ten other independent journalists and eleven prominent reformist politicians of the so-called G-15 were arrested, ostensibly for demanding democratic reforms in a series of letters to President Isayas Afeworki. The independent press, including the Setit newspaper, had covered the confrontation between the president and the reformers.\\r\\nIn April 2002, CPJ, the Committee to Protect Journalists, reported that Isaak was hospitalized due to torture. The Eritrean government denied that he has been tortured, but did not allow anyone to visit him. Isaak had not been tried before a court. Because he held dual Swedish and Eritrean citizenship, Swedish authorities began working for his release, using \"silent diplomacy\" according to government sources.\\r\\nOn 19 November 2005, Isaak was released from jail, and according to official Eritrean sources, he was released only to see a doctor. After only two days of freedom, and while on his way to the hospital, Isaak was imprisoned again. He is believed to be held in Carchele prison in central Asmara.\\r\\nEvery week, a number of organizations, including Reporters Without Borders and the National Press Club, petition the Eritrean Embassy in Stockholm to free Isaak.\\r\\nOn 27 March 2009, four of the five largest newspapers in Sweden, Aftonbladet, Expressen, Dagens Nyheter and Svenska Dagbladet, featured a plea for the release of Isaak on their front pages. In addition, the five newspapers will feature joint reports on Isaak\\'s situation, and a joint petition was handed over to the Eritrean Embassy in Stockholm on 4 May. By 4 May, 209,963 people had signed the petition.\\r\\nOn 26 May 2009, during an interview with the Swedish TV4 (channel 4) the president of Eritrea dismissed the case altogether with the words \"We will not have any trial and we will not free him. We know how to handle his kind.\" and \"To me, Sweden is irrelevant. The Swedish government has nothing to do with us.\"\\r\\nThe \"silent diplomacy\" method that the Swedish authorities have employed to work for Isaak\\'s release has been criticized by the Swedish media, and the president of the Swedish branch of Reporters Without Borders, Jesper Bengtsson, issued a statement in April 2010, saying that \"[i]t is a disgrace that Dawit remains in prison and it is remarkable that the Swedish government does not try harder to get him released.\"\\r\\nAfter the release of the Albanian-American pilot James Berisha, the 1st Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo, Behgjet Pacolli, will start a new mission in Eritrea for the release of Isaak.\\r\\n\\r\\nRumors about death\\r\\nOn several occasions, rumors have circulated that Isaak is no longer alive, the most recent of which was on 27 October 2011, his 47th birthday, when Swedish commercial radio channel \"Radio 1\" claimed that Dawit Isaak could well be dead. In April 2012, rumours of his death once again began circulating when several Eritrean politicians stated that he had died in prison. When a government official from Eritrea was confronted about the rumours during an interview in Sweden, he avoided the question and refused to answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards\\r\\nOn 2 March 2007, Isaak was awarded a newly established prize, dedicated to the memory of Anna Politkovskaya and awarded by the Swedish National Press Club.\\r\\nIn 2009 Isaak was awarded the Kurt-Tucholsky-Prize by the Swedish P.E.N.-Association.\\r\\nHe was awarded the Norwegian \"Ytringsfrihetsprisen\", the Freedom of Expression Prize for 2009, at the annual meeting of the Norwegian Authors\\' Union on 14 March 2010.\\r\\nIn October 2011 Isaak received the Golden Pen of Freedom Award of the World Association of Newspapers.

Leaving Jamaica in the early 1960s, he moved to Britain, where he freelanced as a broadcaster and journalist, also travelling and living elsewhere in Europe, before deciding to relocate to West Africa. Since the latter 1960s he has been based mainly in Nigeria, of which country he became a citizen in the mid-1980s, while continuing his connection to cultural ventures in the UK and US.\\r\\nBarrett initially drew critical attention for his debut novel, Song for Mumu, which on its London publication in 1967 was favourably noticed by such reviewers as Edward Baugh and Marina Maxwell (who respectively described it as \"remarkable\" and \"significant\"); more recently it has been commended for its \"pervading passion, intensity, and energy\", referred to as a classic, and features on \"must-read\" lists of Jamaican books.\\r\\nParticularly during the 1960s and 1970s, Barrett was a participant in significant drama and film projects in Britain, and became well known as an experimental and progressive essayist, his work being concerned with issues of black identity and dispossession, the African Diaspora, and the survival of descendants of black Africans, now dispersed around the world.\\r\\nOne of his sons is the Nigerian writer A. Igoni Barrett, with whom he has also worked professionally.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife in Jamaica\\r\\nLindsay Barrett was born in Lucea, Jamaica, into an agricultural family. His father, Lionel Barrett, was a lifelong farmer and senior agriculturist with the Jamaican Ministry of Agriculture; his great-uncle, A. P. Hanson, founded the Jamaica Agricultural Society in the early 1930s. Barrett attended Clarendon College in Jamaica, and he has written that he was inspired to decide to live in Africa by a visit that pan-Africanist Dudley Thompson paid to the school in 1957: \"In that visit he spoke eloquently of the cultural links that existed between Africa, especially Ghana, and Jamaica. He told us that the future held great potential for the restoration of our souls if we found ways to renew our links with the continent.\"\\r\\nAfter graduating from high school in 1959 Barrett worked as an apprentice journalist at the Daily Gleaner newspaper and for its sister afternoon tabloid, The Star. In early 1961, he became a news editor for the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation, where his mentor was the Jamaican journalist and political analyst John Maxwell.\\r\\n\\r\\nMove to Europe: 1962–66\\r\\nLess than a year later, Barrett moved to England, where he worked as a freelancer for the BBC World Service in London and for the Transcription Centre, an organisation that recorded and broadcast the works of African writers in Europe and Africa.\\r\\nIn 1962, Barrett went to France, and during the next four years travelled throughout Europe and North Africa as a journalist and feature writer. While in Paris, he was associated with many notable black poets and artists, including Langston Hughes, Lebert \"Sandy\" Bethune, Ted Joans, Beauford Delaney and Herb Gentry. In 1966, Barrett\\'s book The State of Black Desire (three poems and three essays \"focusing on the theme of black alienation, exile, and black art\"), illustrated by St. Kitts painter Larry Potter, was one of the first publications of the press of the Paris bookshop Shakespeare and Company.\\r\\nBarrett\\'s first novel, Song for Mumu, was written between April 1962 and October 1966, and published in London by Longman in 1967.\\r\\nWriting in 2023 at the age of 82, Barrett would say: \"I left Jamaica without informing any member of my family that I would do so in my nineteenth year and so my twenties were spent in absolute exile from the heart of my upbringing. Whenever anyone asked me then what my objective for the future was I always told them I would be going to Africa to find out what the true character of my history really was. I must admit that the decision to do so at that time was based on romantic assumptions and naivete rather than on any well considered realistic plan of action, However, in the five years that I spent in Europe at that time I underwent an apprenticeship in feature writing and freelance broadcasting that was unparalleled. Instead of pursuing formal academic training as most of my peers were doing at that time I became a fanatic devotee of creative writing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nMigration to Africa: 1966 onwards\\r\\nIn February 1966, Barrett left Paris to travel to Dakar, Senegal, for the first World Festival of Black Arts, where – described by Negro Digest as \"the fireball from Jamaica\" – he organised a poetry-reading session at the US Cultural Center. His plan had been to \"visit and if possible work in Nkrumah\\'s Ghana, for a short while after the festival. Unfortunately, by the time the festival ended Nkrumah was no longer on the seat in Ghana.\"\\r\\nHaving had in Paris a friend from Sierra Leone, Barrett decided that would be the first West African country where would spend some time, and during the few months he was there (one of his hosts being the then Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sierra Leone, Professor Davidson Abioseh Nicol), he began work as a correspondent for West Africa magazine. Visiting Nigeria in July that year, Barrett took up residence there; he recollects being urged to go there by the writer John Pepper Clark, whom he had met in London in 1961, and whose play The Raft had influenced Barrett\\'s own decision to begin writing plays, particularly one called Jump Kookoo Makka (which, like The Raft, would be performed at the Leicester University Commonwealth Arts Festival in 1967). He has said: \"I came to Nigeria directly because I was influenced by her literature. I came to Africa because I wanted to renew the spirit of ancestral hope. I felt that there was hope in knowing where you came from and that we could renew our links, that we could strengthen our systems.\"\\r\\nFrom 1966 to 1967, Barrett was Secretary of the Mbari Artists Club, which was \"a hub of literary and cultural activities\" in Ibadan: \"We were in a historic, literary setting,\" he recalled, \"when the civil war broke out and disintegrated everything.\" He was Director of the East Central State Information Service during the Nigerian Civil War under Chief Ukpabi Asika.\\r\\nAfter a further stay in London at the beginning of the 1970s, Barrett returned in 1973 to Nigeria, where he was a founding member of the Nigerian Association of Patriotic Writers and Artistes. He became a naturalised Nigerian citizen in the mid-1980s.\\r\\nHe has worked as a lecturer and has taught at many educational establishments in West Africa, including in Ghana, at Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone, and at Nigeria\\'s University of Ibadan, where he lectured on the roots of African and Afro-American literature at the invitation of Professors Wole Soyinka and the late Omafume Onoge.\\r\\nBarrett is also a broadcaster, particularly in Nigerian radio and television, and has produced and presented critically acclaimed programmes on jazz, the arts, and Caribbean-African issues. He has been involved with many cultural initiatives, interacting with a wide range of African diaspora artists visiting Nigeria, including Ornette Coleman, Jimmy Cliff, Jayne Cortez, Melvin Edwards, and others.\\r\\nIn London in the 1980s, he was part of Penumbra Productions, an independent production company, with members including Horace Ové, H. O. Nazareth, Farrukh Dhondy, Mustapha Matura, Michael Abbensetts and Margaret Busby, among whose projects was a series of films based on lectures by C. L. R. James.\\r\\n\\r\\nWriting\\r\\nSumming up his writing career in an article on his 70th birthday, Barrett said: \"I can remember a time in my early twenties when I lived in London, Frankfurt, Paris, and Tangier and, for a while in Tunisia and Libya, when I genuinely lived in a whirl of such oblivion that it appeared unlikely that I would ever witness my thirtieth birthday. For this reason I wrote at that time like one possessed and I still believe my work of that period represents the high points of my creative output. ... While the poetry and fiction that came later tends to be more cautious and formal than the fiction and poetry of my youth, in my journalistic output I seem to have become increasingly attached to formal reportage.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNovels\\r\\nBarrett\\'s first novel, Song for Mumu – \"an allegorical novel of desire, love, and loss\" – was published to acclaim in 1967 in London, where he took part in readings alongside writers associated with the Caribbean Artists Movement. The reviewer in The Observer said: \"Lindsay Barrett\\'s prose has vitality; it\\'s usually simple, often demotic, packed with images. He can convey sensuality that is innocent and tragedy that is no less frightening for being unsought.\" A. R. Chisholm of the Melbourne Age described the novel as \"violently, lyrically, movingly original: A primitive masterpiece.\"\\r\\nSong for Mumu was one of the first titles published in 1974 by executive editor Charles Harris at Howard University Press in the US, where it was received favourably by critics such as Martin Levin of The New York Times, who commented that \"What shines ... is its language.\" Reviewing the novel for Caribbean Quarterly, Edward Baugh wrote of \"the way in which it moves in worlds of magic and madness, myth and primitive ritual, not so as to exploit their strangeness, but to make them familiar, to emphasise their immediate reality, no less real than the reality of the natural and everyday. In his own distinctive way, Barrett is doing something not dissimilar to what, in their separate ways, Wilson Harris and the Cuban Alejo Carpentier have done\". More recently, Al Creighton writing in the Stabroek News referred to Song for Mumu as an \"intriguingly poetic experimental novel\", in the context of seeing Barrett as a disciple of Nigerian writer Gabriel Okara, \"the virtual father of modern African literature in English\". Song for Mumu featured among 308 titles of \"the greatest list of Caribbean reads\" that was produced in 2020 by the Bocas Lit Fest.\\r\\nBarrett\\'s second novel, Lipskybound, was published in Enugu, Nigeria, in 1977, and has influenced the work of many younger Nigerian writers who are interested in breaking the mould of traditional creative writing. As he himself described the work in 1972, having struggled for several years writing it: \"It is an exposition of the heart of natural vengeance in the soul of the transplanted African and of the violent nature of the truth of his spirit out of necessity.\"\\r\\nBarrett\\'s third published novel, Veils of Vengeance Falling, appeared in 1985 and has been used as a set book in the Department of English at the University of Port Harcourt.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlays and film scripts\\r\\nFrom the 1960s onwards, Barrett authored many plays that were staged in England and in Nigeria. Jump Kookoo Makka was presented at the Leicester University Commonwealth Arts Festival in 1967 (directed by Cosmo Pieterse) and that same year Home Again was performed by Wole Soyinka\\'s company.\\r\\nOver four nights in January 1973, Barrett\\'s play Black Blast! – an exploration of Caribbean history through music, mime and dance – was performed in London, the first play by a Black writer at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (with an all-Black cast, including Yemi Ajibade, Yulisa Amadu Maddy, Leslie Palmer, Eddie Tagoe, Karene Wallace, Basil Wanzira, and Elvania Zirimu, directed by Horace Ové) and filmed for a special edition of the BBC 2\\'s arts and entertainment programme Full House (broadcast on Saturday, 3 February 1973) devoted to the work of West Indian writers, artists, musicians and filmmakers. Black Blast! was described as \"ritual theatre with music and dance\" that \"expresses in terms of raw bodily experience the history of the Black peoples of the world through colonization, slavery and the complexities of the neocolonialist era\".\\r\\nBarrett\\'s And After This We Heard of Fire was produced by the Ibadan Arts Theatre in Nigeria in 1971. In 1972, his theatrical collage of drama, dance and music, Sighs of a Slave Dream, was the first major production to be staged at the Keskidee Centre, in north London, performed by a Nigerian troupe under the direction of Pat Amadu Maddy. It portrays the capture and enslavement of Africans, their transport across the Atlantic, and their suffering on American plantations. Various plays by Barrett have been performed at the Mbari Theatre of the University of Ibadan and on Nigerian National Radio. His work was also broadcast in the BBC\\'s Thirty-Minute Theatre radio programme.\\r\\nBarrett has occasionally written film scripts and commentaries, as for Horace Ové\\'s 1973 BBC documentary King Carnival.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoetry\\r\\nBarrett is in addition a poet, whose early militant poems dealt with racial and emotional conflict and exile, as evidenced in his collection, The Conflicting Eye, published under the pseudonym \"Eseoghene\" (an Urhobo name meaning \"God\\'s gift\") in 1973. That same year he produced a staged version of Linton Kwesi Johnson\\'s poem Voices of the Living and the Dead at London\\'s Keskidee Centre, with music by the reggae group Rasta Love. Barrett\\'s subsequent volumes of poetry are A Quality of Pain and Other Poems (1986) and A Memory of Rivers; Poems Out of the Niger Delta (2006), both books published in Nigeria.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs editor and contributor\\r\\nBarrett\\'s work has appeared in anthologies, including Black Fire: an Anthology of Afro-American Writing, edited by LeRoi Jones (Imamu Amiri Baraka) and Larry Neal, and Black Arts: an Anthology of Black Creations in 1969. He wrote the foreword to a new edition of Amiri Baraka\\'s Four Black Revolutionary Plays: Experimental Death Unit 1, A Black Mass, Great Goodness of Life, and Madheart, published in 1997. Barrett has been an associate editor of several periodicals, including Afriscope (of which he was Associate Editor) in Nigeria, and Transition Magazine in Uganda, and he was a contributor to seminal black British publications in the 1960s such as Daylight, Flamingo, Frontline and West Indian World.\\r\\nHe has also contributed numerous short stories, poems, essays, and articles to journals that include Black Orpheus, Negro Digest/Black World, Revolution, Two Cities, New African, Magnet, The Black Scholar, Black Lines, West Africa magazine, and The Africa Report.\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalism and non-fiction\\r\\nAs a journalist, Barrett has written on the conflicts and ongoing political circumstances in Liberia and Sierra Leone, and was the co-founder, with Tom Kamara, of the Liberian newspaper The New Democrat. He was a correspondent throughout Africa for the London-based news magazine West Africa for more than three decades, as well as working as a photo-journalist for a variety of publications. He maintained weekly columns in several Nigerian newspapers over the years, including his widely read \"From the Other Side\" in the Nigerian tabloid The Sun. Barrett continues to work as a political analyst and commentator on Nigerian current events. According to Ozolua Uhakheme: \"In all the civil wars in the West coast of Africa, he has played the role of an interpreter of the essence for peace.\"\\r\\nBarrett has regularly written on music, literature, film and other cultural and social issues. Having been a long-time friend of Fela Kuti, he wrote a Prologue for the 2010 Cassava Republic Press edition of the biography Fela: This Bitch of a Life by Carlos Moore. Among Barrett\\'s other book contributions are literary interviews, such as one with Chinua Achebe conducted in London in June 1981, included in Conversations with Chinua Achebe (ed. Bernth Lindfors, 1997). In 2016, Barrett published a collection entitled Rainbow Reviews and Other Literary Adventures.\\r\\nBarrett has also written books of non-fiction and biographies. His articles appear regularly in Nigerian newspapers such as Vanguard, Daily Trust, This Day, and The Guardian, and he also does reports for television.\\r\\n\\r\\nVisual art\\r\\nIn the earlier part of his career, Barrett was also on occasion a visual artist, as evidenced by his 1970s painting \"Spirit Night\", included in the exhibition Beyond Borders: Bill Hutson & Friends at the Mechanical Hall Gallery. University of Delaware (31 August – 9 December 2016).\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards and accolades\\r\\nIn 1970, Barrett\\'s writing received the fifth Conrad Kent Rivers Memorial Award from the Illinois Arts Council.\\r\\nIn 2004, writing about the depletion of the Black Arts Movement, Amiri Baraka referenced Barrett with the words: \"Can someone summon Lindsay Barrett who left Jamaica for Nigeria, who erupted with a scarlet beauty?\"\\r\\nIn August 2009, Barrett\\'s poetry collection A Memory of Rivers: Poems Out of the Niger Delta was one of nine books shortlisted for the $50,000 NLNG Prize in Nigeria.\\r\\nBarrett has been named as one of \"The 11 Best Jamaican Writers\", alongside Claude McKay, Roger Mais, Andrew Salkey, Sylvia Wynter, Lorna Goodison, Kerry Young, Margaret Cezair-Thompson, Colin Channer, Kei Miller, and Marlon James.\\r\\nOn the occasion of Barrett\\'s 75th birthday, 15 September 2016, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari issued a statement commending Barrett for \"his love for Nigeria, which inspired his relocation from the Caribbean to settle in the country, raise a family and also take up Nigerian citizenship in the 80s\", adding that \"the thematic thrusts of [his] writings on Africa, Africans in Diaspora and Afro-Americans have contributed significantly to global discourse on the history and identity of the black race and the renewed interest in the future of Africa and people of African descent.\"\\r\\nIn April 2017, Barrett was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award \"for excellence in creative writing\" by the Institute of Arts and Culture at the University of Port Harcourt during the Gabriel Okara Literary Festival.\\r\\nIn an interview for Barrett\\'s 80th birthday, Wole Olaoye described him as \"the best export from the Caribbean to Motherland Nigeria in the last century.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected bibliography\\r\\nCreative writing\\r\\nThe State of Black Desire (three poems and three essays, illustrated by Larry Potter; Paris: Shakespeare and Co., 1966; reprinted Benin City, Nigeria: Ethiope, 1974).\\r\\nSong for Mumu (novel; London: Longman, 1967; Washington, DC: Howard University Press, 1974).\\r\\nThe Conflicting Eye (poems, published under the pseudonym Eseoghene; London: Paul Breman, 1973).\\r\\nLipskybound (novel; Enugu, Nigeria: Bladi House, 1977).\\r\\nVeils of Vengeance Falling (novel; Enugu, Nigeria: Fourth Dimension, 1985, ISBN 9789781561788)\\r\\nA Quality of Pain and Other Poems (poems; Nigeria: Gaskiya Corporation, 1986, ISBN 9789781940729).\\r\\nA Memory of Rivers; Poems Out of the Niger Delta (poems; Nigeria: Daylight, 2006, ISBN 9789780193232).\\r\\nVisiting Eternity (poems, 2016).\\r\\nRainbow Reviews and Other Literary Adventures (collected reviews, 2016).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs playwright and scriptwriter\\r\\n1967: Jump Kookoo Makka, Leicester University Commonwealth Arts Festival\\r\\n1971: And After This We Heard of Fire, Ibadan Arts Theatre, Nigeria\\r\\n1972: Sighs of a Slave Dream, Keskidee Centre, London, directed by Pat Amadu Maddy\\r\\n1973: Black Blast!, ICA, London\\r\\n1974: Late Flood, Thirty Minute Theatre, BBC Radio 4\\r\\n\\r\\nNon-fiction\\r\\nDanjuma, the Making of a General (biography; Enugu, Nigeria: Fourth Dimension, 1979).\\r\\nAgbada to Khaki: Reporting a Change of Government in Nigeria (non-fiction, Enugu, Nigeria: Fourth Dimension, 1985).\\r\\nLiberian Notes: A Study of Conflict and Resistance: A PACs Report, Yandia Printing Press, 1993.\\r\\nWith Babatunde Faniyan, Wind of Hope: The Authorised Biography of Dr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan (Onyoma Research Publications, Nigeria, 2010, ISBN 9789788195313)\\r\\n\\r\\nBook contributions\\r\\n\"The Tide Inside It Rages\", in Amiri Baraka and Larry Neal (eds), Black Fire: An Anthology of Afro-American Writing (1968), Black Classic Press, 2007, ISBN 978-1574780390.\\r\\n\"Giving Writers a Voice: an interview with Chinua Achebe\", West Africa, 22 June 1981, 1405–07.

He trained as a civil engineer and spent his early career as a surveyor in Veracruz and Sonora.  He married in 1891.\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalism\\r\\nBy 1892 he had moved to El Paso, Texas, where he published a newspaper entitled El Independiente (The Independent).  This drew the attention of United States federal authorities who endeavored to maintain U.S. neutrality in Mexican affairs by monitoring the activities of Mexican rebels who resided north of the international border.  In 1895, Aguirre participated in protests against the government of Porfirio Díaz.\\r\\nOn 5 February 1896 Aguirre published a call for rebellion against the government of Mexico.  The next month the United States government arrested Aguirre and another journalist, Flores Chapa, because the Mexican consul accused them of conspiring to reenter Mexico and engage in revolutionary actions.  Aguirre and Chapa were acquitted in U.S. federal court after the U.S. consul's investigation concluded that they had only engaged in legitimate newspaper publishing.\\r\\nIn July 1896 a conflict arose along the US-Mexican border known as the Yaqui Uprising, which was associated with a popular leader named Teresa Urrea.  Mexican government documents from the period connect Lauro Aguirre to Urrea and other revolutionaries.  Aguirre worked with Urrea to organize raids against Mexican customs offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevolutionary activities\\r\\nIn 1902 Aguirre wrote to President Theodore Roosevelt to request protection as a political refugee, after having heard a rumor that the Díaz government planned to kidnap him.  The previous year, the mayor of Ciudad Juárez had complained to United States authorities about subversive activities by Aguirre associated with his newspaper, which had been renamed El Progresista.  The U.S. consul charged with investigating Aguirre's complaint found no evidence of a kidnapping plot.\\r\\nAfterward Aguirre launched another newspaper, La Reforma Social, and joined the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), which was the most extreme of the anti-Díaz organizations.  Aguirre became president of the El Paso PLM branch and organized an attempted takeover of Ciudad Juárez.  Their plans failed because Díaz government agents infiltrated the PLM. Enrique C. Creel, the governor of Chihuahua, attempted to get Aguirre extradited in 1906 by framing him for murder and having Mexican officials present forged evidence to American officials.  Aguirre was arrested and jailed in the United States for forty days before evidence of his innocence prompted his release.\\r\\nAguirre continued to publish about Mexican politics with another newspaper, El Precursor.

From then on, he taught at several different drawing schools.\\r\\nIt was the year 1960 when he had his first solo exhibition of figurative impressionism, a trend that, following that year, he dedicated to avant-garde constructivist geometry.\\r\\n\\r\\nEurope\\r\\nThe first award given to Master Jorge Riveros was from the Salon of Artists from Santander in 1964. That same year he traveled to Europe to take a course on the History of Art at the Instituto de Cultura Hisp�nica and to specialize in Mural Painting at the Escuela de Bellas Artes in Madrid, Spain. One year later, in 1965, he moved to Germany and was involved in several individual and group exhibitions in different cities of that country.\\r\\nIn 1969 he began to experiment with geometric abstraction and came to form a part of the \"Semikolon\" group of artists, holding numerous exhibitions with that association. That year he also became a member of the Art Association for Rhineland and Westphalia in D�sseldorf. Riveros was issued an invitation in 1971 to form a part of the International Organization of Constructivist Painters, \"Circle of Constructivist Work,\" headquartered in the city of Bonn.\\r\\n\\r\\nColombia\\r\\nIn 1975, Riveros decided to return to Colombia. He received an appointment as a professor in the Fine Arts Department at Universidad Nacional de Colombia; the main courses he taught were Still Life, Portraiture, Nudes, and Landscapes until 1999. By 1977, he was also a professor of drawing and painting at Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano and Universidad de La Sabana.\\r\\nHis painting moved toward Constructivism with clear pre-Columbian influences at the beginning of the 80s and for approximately two decades, displaying more intense and varied colors. \\r\\nIn 1983 he participated as a judge and a special guest in the first Visual Arts Salon in C�cuta, and the following year, the government of Argentina invited him to represent Colombian art at the National Art Fund in his capacity as a painter and a Fine Arts professor at Universidad Nacional de Colombia.\\r\\nIn 1986 he became a founding member of the Museo Bolivariano de Arte in Santa Marta, Colombia. Four years later, in 1990, he traveled to Germany to study, and participated in an auction of Latin American Art at Christie\\'s New York.\\r\\nRiveros experimented with large-format murals in 1996.\\r\\nIn 1999 he concluded his teaching career, and published the book \"Jorge Riveros\" written by Francisco Gil Tovar and V�ctor Gu�dez. That same year, the Governor of Norte de Santander decreed that the life and work of Jorge Riveros would be included in school curriculum.\\r\\nRiveros has participated in art fairs such as ARTFI in Santo Domingo and ARTBO in Bogot�. Throughout his career, he has also worked in metal sculpture and has undertaken several projects for public spaces in Bogot�. In 2010 he developed plans for urban fixtures and installations.\\r\\nRevisiting his work developed in Germany during the 60s and 70s in geometric abstraction, as of 1996 Riveros has completed several works using his ideas and concepts from that era.\\r\\nOn 20 July 2014, in celebration of the Independence of Colombia, the artist drew Google\\'s commemorative Doodle for that day. .\\r\\nHe currently lives and works in Bogot�.\\r\\n\\r\\nSolo art shows\\r\\nGroup exhibitions\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', \"Abdelkader Bensalah (Arabic: عبد القـادر بن صالح, romanized: ʿAbd āl-Qādar bin Ṣāliḥ, 24 November 1941 – 22 September 2021) was an Algerian politician.\\r\\nHe served as the President of the Council of the Nation, the upper house of the bicameral Parliament of Algeria, between 2002 and 2019.\\r\\nAfter President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who had ruled the country for 20 years, resigned in April 2019, Bensalah served as the Acting Head of State of Algeria until Abdelmadjid Tebboune took office after winning the presidential election in December 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical career\\r\\nAfter working in Beirut to direct the Algerian Center for Information and Culture from 1970 to 1974, Bensalah returned to Algeria to work as a journalist at the state newspaper El Chaâb for three years, before being elected to represent the  Tlemcen Province in 1977.

Funes won the 2009 presidential election as the candidate of the left-wing Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) party and took office on 1 June 2009. Since 2016, Funes and his immediate family have been living in exile in Nicaragua due to allegations of criminality during his tenure. In July 2023, he was placed under sanctions by the U.S. State Department due to his conviction in absentia for negotiations related to the gang truces he made while in office, illicit enrichment, and tax evasion.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and education\\r\\nFunes was born in San Salvador. He received his high school diploma (Bachillerato) from the Externado San José, and studied at Universidad Centroamericana but did not graduate. Both Externado and UCA are Jesuit institutions, and Funes has mentioned his relationship to the Jesuits murdered by the Salvadoran military in 1989 as of particular significance in his professional and personal development. In 1994 he was awarded the Maria Moors Cabot prize from Columbia University for promoting press freedom and inter-American understanding.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer in journalism\\r\\nPrior to his involvement with politics of El Salvador, Funes was a journalist who hosted a popular interview show on television. He made appearances on Channel 12 and CNN en Español, and also hosted local news programs which were critical of previous governments. He was a reporter during the Salvadoran Civil War and interviewed leftist rebel leaders. It was during this time that he became more sympathetic to leftists in El Salvador, and he considers himself to be center-left.\\r\\n\\r\\nCampaign and Presidency\\r\\nFunes was nominated to be the FMLN candidate on 28 September 2007 and competed against the Nationalist Republican Alliance\\'s candidate Rodrigo Ávila, a former deputy director of the National Police. Funes won the 2009 presidential election with 51.32% of the popular vote, thus winning election in a single round.  He was the country\\'s second left-leaning president (the first being Arturo Araujo), as well as the first FMLN party leader not to have fought in the Salvadoran civil war.  His swearing-in on 1 June marked only the third time in the country\\'s history that a governing party peacefully transferred power to the opposition.\\r\\nHis presidential campaign was highlighted by statements endorsing moderate political policies. He has promised to better programs such as health care in rural areas and crime prevention. Political opponents stated that Funes\\' election would herald an era of Venezuelan influence but he insisted that \"integration with Central America and strengthening relations with North America will be the priority of our foreign policy\". Funes has also promised to keep the U.S. dollar as El Salvador\\'s official currency (dollarization took place in 2001 under President Francisco Flores Pérez).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs President\\r\\nSince coming to power, Funes\\' administration has implemented a wide range of social reforms designed to combat poverty and inequality, including the institution of various poverty alleviation programs in the most impoverished communities, the abolition of public health care fees, the introduction of free shoes, meals and uniforms for schoolchildren, the distribution of property titles to hundreds of families, the introduction of monthly stipends and job training for those living in extreme poverty, and pensions for the elderly. In addition, investments have been made in improving school infrastructure, a presidential decree has been made against discrimination on the basis of gender and sexual orientation in the public services, two working groups on indigenous affairs have been created as a means of bringing about better representation of the interests of El Salvador\\'s indigenous communities, a community health plan has been introduced, improvements have been made in teacher\\'s salaries, and measures have been introduced to combat illiteracy.\\r\\nAccording to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the poverty rate dropped by six percentage points to 40 per cent in 2014.\\r\\nUpon his inauguration on 1 June 2009, Funes resumed Salvadoran diplomatic relations with Cuba. El Salvador previously suspended diplomatic relations with Cuba 50 years ago due to the Cuban Revolution.\\r\\nIn November 2009, President Funes had to face the natural disaster that greatly affected communities in Cuscatlán, San Salvador and San Vicente as a result of the rain brought by Hurricane Ida.  A community in San Vicente called Verapaz disappeared because it was buried by huge rocks that fell from the nearby volcano.  Civil Protection, which is the government entity in charge of handling catastrophes, rehabilitated public schools in which refugees stayed for more than 3 months while they found a place to stay from family or friends. The Army and the Red Cross of El Salvador rescued many people from the communities.\\r\\nA pension was created for soldiers and guerrillas maimed during the civil war. On the anniversary of the peace agreement, Mauricio Funes acknowledged on behalf of the state the participation of the Armed Forces in war crimes and apologized to the victims. He was criticized by the leader of the right-wing opposition, Armando Calderón, who said that \"the State should never apologize.\\r\\nFunes has been criticized for lack of a plan to fight El Salvador\\'s increased crime.  In response, the President has ordered the deployment of the army to cooperate with police authorities in their fight against crime.\\r\\nMore recently, there have been reports of newly formed death squads operating in El Salvador, due in part to a lack of response of the police.\\r\\nIn January 2010, after a public denouncement of Funes\\' former cabinet member Francisco Gómez, local Salvadoran media uncovered plans whereby almost all government publicity and advertising were to be carried, without any previous public solicitation (as required by Salvadoran Law), by advertising agency Polistepeque, S.A. de C.V. Some advisers to the president are members of its board of directors, and allegedly Funes himself has some participation through stock in that agency.\\r\\nThe President reacted to these accusations by stating that no other advertising agency in El Salvador has the experience or capacity to manage government publicity and advertising, despite the fact that El Salvador has many local and international advertising agencies such as BBDO.\\r\\nIn 2016, Funes denied giving perks to gangs during the 2012–14 truce.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal life\\r\\nFunes\\' brother was killed during the Salvadoran Civil War. His oldest son, Alejandro Funes Velasco, was murdered in Paris at 27 years of age.\\r\\nFunes was married to Vanda Pignato, the former First Lady of El Salvador who was involved in the Workers\\' Party in Brazil. They have one son, Gabriel. In October 2014, Funes publicly acknowledged that he and Pignato had separated. The political asylum granted to Mauricio Funes by the Government of Nicaragua, included this benefit for his partner, Ada Mitchell Guzmán Sigüenza, as well as his three sons. In July 2019, Funes (along with his wife and two sons) became a naturalized citizen of Nicaragua, where he and his immediate family have been residing in exile since 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nCriminal charges\\r\\nOn 10 February 2016 the El Salvador Supreme Court ruled that Funes would face a civil trial for charges of illegally laundering more than $700,000 in personal bank accounts. Nicaragua has granted political asylum to Mauricio Funes, who is being accused of illicit enrichment in El Salvador. Mauricio Funes has not been able to justify personal transactions for over $600,000. The formal accusation against Mauricio Funes states that he and his family increased their assets without justification for an amount of over US$728,000. The income of the President of El Salvador in 2015, one year after Mauricio Funes left office, was US$5,181.72 per month. On 28 November 2017, El Salvador\\'s second civil court found Funes guilty of illegal enrichment. The sentence was against Mauricio Funes and his son who is with him in Nicaragua under asylum protection, ordering that they had to restitute $420,000 to the state. As of 2019 Interpol has twice rejected the arrest request against Mauricio Funes.\\r\\nOn 29 May 2023, Funes was sentenced to 14 years in prison in absentia because of negotiations related to the gang truces he made while in office. On 6 July, he was sentenced to an additional six years for tax evasion. In July 2023 he was placed under sanctions by the U.S. State department.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\\r\\nMauricioFunes.org – Official Mauricio Funes Website\\r\\nOfficial Campaign Website (in Spanish)\\r\\nBiography of Mauricio Funes by CIDOB (in Spanish)\\r\\nFirst President from the Left Elected in San Salvador by Katie Kohlstedt, 6 June 2009\\r\\nEl Salvador Rising by Tom Hayden, The Nation, 15 June 2009\\r\\nEl Salvador’s \\'Date with History\\' by Oscar Faria, Workers World, 2 July 2009', 'Boris Aleksandrovich Balashov (Russian: Бори́с Алекса́ндрович Балашо́в; 7 December 1927 – 20 January 1974) was Editor-in-Chief of the Soviet magazine \"Filateliya SSSR\" (\"Philately of the USSR\").\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nBorn in 1927 in the family of a worker.

This French nonprofit association works towards a better media coverage of LGBTI issues, of issues related to gender identity and sexual orientation. Its members are journalists from a wide range of newsrooms as well as freelance journalists. Since 2017, the AJL has been organizing an annual ceremony, the « Out d’or » (the Golden Outs or Outs of Gold), during which artists, journalists and diverse personalities are awarded for their work towards LGBTI visibility.\\r\\n\\r\\nFounded in the wake of the debates surrounding the French Marriage Equality Bill\\r\\nThe Association of LGBTI Journalists (which became the LGBTI journalists’ association ) was founded in May 2013 shortly after the Marriage Equality Bill (known as Mariage pour Tous) was passed in France. Its founding members were shocked by the careless manner in which the media platformed the homophobic arguments of the bill\\'s opponents. These journalists regretted that « the space given to the opponents and their hate speech had been justified by the need to give a « balanced treatment » of this issue ». \\r\\n\\r\\nEverything happened as if the homophobic nature of the comments were only a matter of opinion and not a punishable offence », the association explains in its introduction.\\r\\nThe members of the AJL wish to challenge the media « each time content that is insulting and discriminatory against gay, lesbians, bi, transgender and intersex persons is published ».The creation of the AJL was marked by the publication of a collective article for an LGBT journalists’ association published in the daily newspaper Libération on 16 May 2013. « Through its scrutiny of the « Fourth Estate », the association probably hopes to contribute to the change in mentalities », later wrote the news weekly L\\'Express. The AJL got its inspiration from the American National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association, founded in 1990 by Leroy F. Aarons.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivities of the AJL\\r\\nOn its website, the association details its different activities: the publication of studies, of a best-practice tool kit, acting as media watchdog, teaching and awareness-raising journalism schools, participating in conferences... The AJL engages and challenges the media when it feels that the LGBT people are misrepresented. In 2014, it questioned TV5 Monde about the terms it chose to present a debate on its Facebook.\\r\\nOn October 13, 2016, the association wrote a piece to expose the transphobic remarks that occurred on the set of the opening show of the Grand journal (Canal +) new season, during the first appearance of Brigitte Boréale, a transgender woman, as a columnist. The AJL announced it would petition the Conseil supérieur de l\\'audiovisuel (CSA, Superior Council of the Audiovisual.) In 2016, the AJL published another article in the daily newspaper Libération about the media coverage of the 12 June 2016 Orlando shooting. \"When the details American shooting became known, very few French news outlet underlined the homophobic nature of the attack\", wrote the AJL. The AJL also takes a stance about journalists’ working-conditions. For instance, in February 2019, after the cyber-bullying of women journalists by male journalists belonging to the « Ligue du LOL », the AJL and the feminist association Prenons la Une co-signed an article titled \"The League of the LOL is by no means an exception\" in Le Monde. In this article, the AJL urged \"the editorial managers to take stock of the extent of the cyber-bullying targeting female journalists, in particular if they belong to an ethnic minority, are differently-abled, fat, or if they belong to the LGBTQ+ community\". The AJL recommends \"hiring, in mass, women, people from diverse ethnic backgrounds, LGBTQ+ people to fill in the key jobs in the newsrooms » so as to do way with « the reality of a male domination based on the cooptation and the club mentality of white, straight men\".\\r\\nThe AJL takes an interest in the way LGBT characters are portrayed on TV fiction, as was the case about the show Louis(e), which was the first French TV series broadcast by TFI with a transgender heroin. The AJL regularly takes part in conferences, for instance the Festival international du Journalisme de Pérouse, in 2015 and the 10th Assises du journalisme in 2016. The AJL raises awareness about prejudice and delivers courses about the fair journalistic treatment of LGBTI issues in journalism schools like the ESJ-Lille or the IPJ.\\r\\nSince heterosexuality is a public matter (and on constant public display), the AJL wishes that homosexuality was not systematically limited to the private sphere. In 2014, the outing of Florian Philippot, the Rassemblement national\\'s vice-president, by the magazine Closer had shocked many political actors and many people in the media. According to the AJL, such an outrage was deeply problematic: its spokesperson explained that \"there is something very French in the belief that revealing somebody\\'s homosexuality is a monstrous invasion of his or her privacy\".\\r\\nAlice Coffin est la co-présidente de l\\'association en 2017,.\\r\\n\\r\\nA tool kit for the media\\r\\nThe AJL wished that the media were more careful in the words used to address LGBT persons, their families, friends and loved ones. On the eve of a demonstration organized by the Manif pour tous on 2 February 2014, the AJL sent a press release to the French media asking fellow journalists to \"be careful in their choices of words\" and to \"do in-depth work on these issues\". Some people criticized this initiative. For instance, a journalist working for the Figaro, compared it to an attempt at « re-education ».\\r\\nDuring the June 2014 Pride March in Paris, the AJL published a toolkit aimed at the media and entitled \"Informing without discriminating\". The daily newspaper 20Minutes wrote: \"with eight chapters such as \"choosing the right words\", \"doing away with lesbian invisibility\", \"stereotypical representation of gay men\" or \"HIV-AIDS, how to talk about it?\", this toolkit points at some of the media\\'s bad habits. It tries to show how some words or expressions are inadequate and suggests alternatives.\" On the whole, the toolkit received a favourable response by the media.\\r\\n\\r\\nOui FM pointed to the necessity of such a toolkit :Sometimes, the way we do our work and our values are discriminatory because of our reflexes, our habits, our hurtful humour, and our discriminatory treatment of information. This is not a text that coerces but one that raises awareness.The weekly L\\'Express wrote: « This initiative invites us to ponder over the importance of words. This also applies to minorities, people for disadvantaged backgrounds, and religious groups\". The women journalists’ collective Prenons la Une took example on the AJL for its own charter of \"good terms\" to used when dealing with violence against women.\\r\\n\\r\\nA charter against homophobia\\r\\nIn May 2015, The AJL announced that 25 French media houses had signed its charter against homophobia. Among them were print dailies (Le Monde, L\\'Équipe...), radio stations (Oui FM, Radio Nova...), and news websites (StreetPress, Mediapart...). In a tribune published by Libération on 14 May 2015, the AJL explained that the signatories had agreed to abide by several principles such as \"the equal treatment of homosexuals, bisexuals and heterosexuals\", \"a fair and equal treatment of transgender persons\" and \"the prevention of any type of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in their newsrooms\". The number of signatories doubled within two years and, in 2017, the AJL stated that about 50 media had signed the charter.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudies on the media treatment of  LGBT people\\r\\nCase study: homophobia on the TV show Touche pas à mon poste !\\r\\nThe AJL acts as a watchdog on the media treatment of LGBT persons and issues. In this spirit, it published a study entitled \"Hanouna on C8: a month of ordinary homophobia\". Over a period of a month (November 2016), the AJL recorded 42 mentions of homosexuality, amongst which 28 were \"meant as bad taste jokes of a sexual nature\", in the show Touche pas à mon poste ! on the TV channel C8\". Many French media quoted this study but the show\\'s host Cyril Hanouna did not comment of the accusation of homophobia leveled against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nA few months later, on 18 May 2017, Hanouna played a homophobic prank live on his show. In return, the AJL, published an article on the website of L\\'Express and stated that« the host of such a popular show should not give such an \"example\" of stigmatizing and humiliating a minority.\" The AJL exposed \" a culture of bullying and homophobia\" that could be conducive to the trivialization of malevolent acts amongst young viewerss. According to the AJL, \"gays are hypersexualized characters on this show and it is precisely one of the cornerstone of homophobic jokes\". According to the AJL:Gays are hypersexualized characters on this show and it is precisely one of the cornerstone of homophobic jokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA study on five talk-shows\\r\\nDuring the month of November 2017, the AJL decide to focus on 5 major French talk-shows: Quotidien, On n’est pas couché, Salut les terriens, L’heure des pros et C politique. This meant watching and analyzing about 100 hours of TV content. The AJL selected these 5 shows \"because of their influence and their popularity\", explained Clément Giuliano, the AJL\\'s co-president. More than 50 occurrences of \"particularly discriminatory or problematic\" content aimed at LGBT minorities, women and Muslims were identified by the AJL. The breakdown is as follows: 17 LGBT-phobic occurrences, including 6 targeting the transgender people, in addition to 20 occurrences of sexism, 9 occurrences of racism, and 8 occurrences during which sexual harassment was blatantly minimized.“The findings of this study are worrying because they point out how difficult it is for TV shows to treat LGBT people, minorities and women in a respectful manner”, the AJL remarked.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe « Out d\\'or » ceremony\\r\\nModelled after the American Glaad Awards, a ceremony named \"Out d’or\" has been organized annually since 2017.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nAlice Coffin\\r\\nIngrid Therwath\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nOfficial website\\r\\nOfficial website of the Out d\\'or', 'Stelio Belloni (Montevideo, 23 August 1920 - 9 September 1989) was a Uruguayan sculptor.\\r\\nHe was son of the notable Realist sculptor José Belloni.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected works\\r\\nGuillermo Cuadri (Santos Garrido).

He studied in the Imperial Academy of Arts (1862–68) at St. Petersburg. He first began with Jewish themes, statues: \"Jewish Tailor\", \"Nathan The Wise\", \"Inquisition\\'s Attack against Jews\", \"The Talmudic Debate\".\\r\\nFrom 1868–1870, Mark Antokolsky lived in Berlin. His statue of Ivan the Terrible (1870) was purchased for the Hermitage by Emperor Alexander II of Russia. The latter approved his work and awarded the sculptor the title of Academic. Antokolsky believed that sculpture was a social and humane ideal. In order to improve his failing health, he moved to the Italian resorts in 1871 and settled in Paris six years later.\\r\\nEvery year Antokolsky would come back to his native town of Vilnius during his summer holidays. Namely here he created his first significant work, high relief \"A Jewish Tailor\", during his summer holidays of 1864.\\r\\nThe work of the young sculptor provoked debate in the Academy in Petersburg. On 28 October 1864, the Council of the Academy decided to award Antokolski with the Small Silver Medal for the \"Tailor\" by the majority of votes.\\r\\nWhile in Vilnius the following year, Antokolski created another high relief - \"A Stingy Man,\" which is sometimes referred to as \"A Stingy Jew Counting his Coins\". The artist was born into a poor family and saw how his father\\'s financial situation improved. The sculpture might have reflected Antokolski\\'s feelings towards his native town of Vilnius, and firstly to his father. This work as well as the first sculpture was positively evaluated by Vasily Stasov who saw \"the features of the simple truth, the things that, previously, nobody dared to think about in sculpture\" in the works of the artist. In 1865, the high relief \"Stingy Man\" was awarded the Grand Silver Medal of the Academy. In later years the sculptor continued working on Jewish themes, which developed into complex, yet unfinished compositions: \"Talmud Dispute\" (1866–1868) and \"Inquisition Attacks the Jews\" (1868–1869). The \"Inquisition\" was M. Antokolski\\'s last work on the Jewish topic in his student years.\\r\\nAccording to the review of the Art Academy, Antokolsky was granted personal name of honorary citizen \"for wonderful knowledge of art\" on 7 April 1870. This fact was also entered into an archival record. Moreover, an inscription remained that Morduchas was excluded from the revision register of Antakalnis Jewish community as a person awarded the name of an honorary citizen.\\r\\nIn 1871 Antokolsky started his first \"Russian\" sculpture, \"Ivan the Terrible\", which made an enormous impression on all valuators and connoisseurs of art. When Emperor Alexander II saw the sculpture he asked to make its bronze copy and allocated the sculptor advance payment of 4,000 roubles. Pavel Tretyakov ordered a marble copy for his gallery.  The funds received enabled the artist to resolve his personal problems. In 1871 (in Vilnius) Antokolski met Jelena (Gene), daughter of a rich Vilnius merchant Judelis Giršovičius Apatovas. The two married on 6 September 1872. \\r\\n\\r\\nAntokolsky used 4,000 rubles for the \"Ivan the Terrible\" to buy half of a big house in Vilnius, the other part of which had previously belonged to his wife. In 1876, upon his regular visits to Vilnius, Antokolsky rebuilt the house. After 1876, Antokolsky was a rare visitor to his native town due to illnesses, work, and exhibitions in Paris and Italy, which took almost all of his time. However, the artist did not break his links with Jewish life. Concern over his nation urged Antokolsky to return to his work \"Inquisition Attacks the Jews\", started 30 years before in Vilnius.\\r\\nIn Rome, Antokolsky completed the statue of Peter the Great for Peterhof Palace in 1872, with its copies for Taganrog and Archangelsk. In 1878 Antokolski exhibited most of his works at the Paris Universal exposition, and received the Grand Prize. In 1880, the personal exhibition of the artist was held in Saint Petersburg, and he was given the rank of professor. Antokolsky left for Paris the same year, and stayed in the French capital until the end of his life, apart from periods on Lake Maggiore, in northern Italy. He realised here the following works: \"Spinoza\" (1881), \"Mephistopheles\" (1884), \"Yaroslav the Wise\" (1889), \"Nestor the Chronicler\" (1889) and \"Yermak Timofeevich\" (1891). Several of his small-size sculptures are in the European Art collection of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem.\\r\\nHe had also planned a monument to Catherine II in Vilnius. However, with the chronic stomach disease getting more severe, the artist suddenly died on 9 July (27 June according to the old calendar) in Frankfurt (Germany). The last work was completed by I. Ginzburg after the sculptor\\'s death. The monument has not survived.\\r\\nAntokolski was buried in St. Petersburg. The train with a special carriage went via Vilnius. Antokolski was buried on the 18th (6th according to the old calendar) of July 1902 in the Jewish part of Preobrazhenskoye Cemetery in St. Petersburg. His grave and tombstone can still be found there, not far from the entrance gate, but were not well maintained and cared for at least up to the 1990s.\\r\\n\\r\\nGallery\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nOlga Litvak, \"Rome and Jerusalem: The Figure of Jesus in the Creation of Mark Antokolsky,\" in Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett and Jonathan Karp (eds), The Art of Being Jewish in Modern Times (Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007) (Jewish Culture and Contexts)\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nMark Antokolsky collection at the Israel Museum.

In 1790 he was named director of sculpture at the recently created Academy of San Carlos in Mexico City. He sailed from C�diz in February, 1791, bringing with him to New Spain, in accordance with the king\\'s instructions, books, instruments of his profession, and plaster copies of classic sculptures from the Vatican Museum.

For these services he did not receive compensation. Thereafter he dedicated himself to the artistic and civil works for which he is now remembered. He also built furniture, made adornments for altars (candelabra, crucifixes, etc.), cast cannons, opened a bathhouse, built coaches and established a kiln.

He worked for Enschedé III as editor of the Opregte Haarlemsche Courant from 1829, later joined by Johannes Enschedé IV. In 1850, they had a quarrel with the city council of Haarlem over the use of the city coat of arms in the newspaper. As city publisher, they had the right, but Haarlem withdrew this privilege, claiming ownership. Jan Justus wrote a book explaining the case of Enschedé, which they won. In the 1860s the paper was considered the best in the country and attracted editors such as Conrad Busken Huet and Multatuli.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n\\r\\nEnschede aan het Klokhuisplein, (Dutch), by Just Enschede, De Vrieseborch, Haarlem, 1991, ISBN 9060763416', 'Charles Etienne Boniface (2 February 1787 – 10 December 1853) was an early nineteenth century music teacher, playwright, journalist and polyglot who was born in France, but who spent his adult life in Southern Africa. His writings and compositions are amongst the earliest publications of what was then the Cape Colony.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly years\\r\\nBoniface was born in Paris in 1787, two years before the outbreak of the French Revolution. At the age of twelve he had a grounding in French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, Greek, had written short dramas in the style of Molière, played the guitar and had learned to dance.\\r\\nIn 1798 his father, who was a prison governor was banished from France on suspicion of helping Sir Sidney Smith to escape back to England. Smith assisted the Boniface family to settle in the Seychelles, a former French colony which, since the beginning of the French Revolution, was effectively under the control of its own assembly. Boniface enrolled in as a cadet in the Royal Navy. In 1806 Cape Colony passed back into British hands and the following year Boniface made his way there via Mozambique on board a Portuguese slave ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nCape Town\\r\\nIn Cape Town, Boniface learnt German, Dutch and English and set himself up as a language and music teacher, particularly playing the French and Spanish guitars. He was the first person in the Cape Colony known to have noted the local music.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the early nineteenth century the theatre was one of the principal leisure activities in the Cape and Boniface, writing in English, Dutch (with the first words of Afrikaans to appear on the South African stage) and his native French was one of the most popular dramatists in the colony. He wrote a series of plays including L\\'Enragé (1807) which, in 1823 was translated into Dutch by Joseph Suasso de Lima with the title De Dolzinnige of De Gewaande Dolleman, in 1813 a ballet-pantomime Het beleg en het Nemen van Troyen (The siege and taking of Troy) and in 1826 he translated Molière\\'s Le Bourgeois gentilhomme (The Bourgeois Gentleman) into Dutch under the title De Burger Edelman.\\r\\nIn 1828 he became a sworn translator in the Cape Supreme Court.\\r\\nHis French-language writings included Relation du naufrage de l\\'Eole, published in 1829—a record of the journey made by the survivors of the Eole, a French ship that was wrecked off the coast of what was then known as \"British Kaffraria\" en route to Réunion from France earlier that year. He intended to translate it into English under the title Narrative of the Shipwreck of the Eole but never completed his translation though a translation and commentary was published in 2012.\\r\\nIn 1830, three years after he had been declared bankrupt following a libel suite, he became the first editor of the Dutch-language newspaper De Zuid-Afrikaan, a post that he held for six months. The Zuid-Afrikaan itself continued for 100 years. While editor he took a pride in stressing the unity between the Dutch and the English cultures.\\r\\nAmongst his notable works with a local flavour was De Nieuwe Ridderorde of De Temperantisten, (The New Knighthood or the Temperance Societies) published in 1832. The play satirised the wave of British puritanism and temperance of the day and in particular John Philip of the London Missionary Society who had secured equality of all free people within the Colony. Although written in Dutch, the local patois (which was later to evolve into Afrikaans) was used by the appropriate characters. This is one of the first pieces of literature in which an Afrikaans-like language appeared.\\r\\nBetween 1837 and 1838 Boniface was editor of the bilingual weekly magazine De Meditator published by Cornelius Moll.  The magazine, which ceased publication in 1838 when Boniface fell out with Moll, took a sympathetic view towards the Voortrekkers.\\r\\nIn 1817 Boniface married Maria Geertruida Heyneman and in the following year their first child Alexis was born. Alexis died in 1828 aged ten and Maria died in 1835 at the age of thirty-nine. Between 1838 and 1843 Boniface had three daughters from a relationship with a freed Mozambique slave Constantia Dorothea le Mordant.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater years in Natal\\r\\nIn November 1843 Boniface obtained permission from the Volksraad of the Natalia Republic to establish a newspaper. He left the Cape Colony to avoid a libel suite and moved to Pietermaritzburg. By the time the paper, named De Natalier, was launched on 5 April 1844 the republic had passed into British control and had been renamed the \"Colony of Natal\".  De Natalier had a circulation of about forty copies per week and soon succumbed to financial pressure resulting from a libel suite. The gap that it left in the market was taken by The Natal Witness, which was launched by Boniface\\'s former colleague Moll in 1846.\\r\\nHis continued association with le Mordant who had followed him to Natal with their three daughters brought contempt from the colonial population.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath\\r\\nOn 10 December 1853 while in Durban Boniface committed suicide by taking laudanum. He was 66 years old.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n\\r\\n[', 'Stanley \"Stan\" Burnside (born 1947) is a Bahamian cartoonist, painter, and costume designer. From 1979 to 2019, he penned the Sideburns editorial cartoon for The Nassau Guardian. As a painter, his style was influenced by the collaborative process of Junkanoo, an annual Caribbean street parade. He was a designer and artistic director for the Junkanoo groups Saxon Superstars and One Family. He has also been involved in several artist collaborations with fellow Bahamian artists and co-founded B-CAUSE, an artist collective dedicated to founding a national art gallery for The Bahamas and a national art school. He has been called a \"pioneering voice in Afrofuturism\".\\r\\nBorn in Nassau, Burnside attended school in the United States, receiving his BFA and MFA from the University of Pennsylvania.

He was educated at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and received his BFA from the University of Pennsylvania. In the late 1960s, Burnside earned his MFA at the University of Pennsylvania. Afterwards, he stayed in the United States, designing album covers for R&B artists and painting.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt career\\r\\nBurnside returned to Nassau in 1979 and was an art professor at the College of The Bahamas until 1990.\\r\\nBurnside was the principal artistic director and designer for the Junkanoo annual street parade groups One Family and Saxon Superstars. He also later led the Marina Village Junkanoo Troupe. Burnside\\'s artistic creations outside of Junkanoo employ the exuberance and colors of the cultural celebration. In 1985 Burnside and his brother Jackson collaborated on Faces, a sculptural painting. Burnside characterized the work as a continuation of the art they had created through Junkanoo, saying \"It was our attempt to take the process, the Junkanoo collaborative process, into the painting studio.\"\\r\\nIn 1991, Burnside joined with five other artists to form B-CAUSE (Bahamian Creative Artists United for Serious Expression). The group, which included his brother Jackson, as well as the artists Brent Malone, Maxwell Taylor, John Beadle, and Antonius Roberts, dedicated themselves to the foundation of the National Art Gallery of The Bahamas and the promotion of a national art school. Burnside, his brother, and Beadle worked together for a season in the Junkanoo shacks before producing the painting series Jammin I. They founded the artist collective Jammin and the trio Burnside-Beadle-Burnside. Roberts and Malone joined the collective in 1993, creating Jammin II. Burnside-Beadle-Burnside exhibited their works in Atlanta, Georgia, for the 1996 Summer Olympics. They also exhibited Jammin III in Brazil at the São Paulo Art Biennial. Burnside later joined with Beadle and Antonius Roberts to continue the Jammin series as Burnside, Beadle & Roberts.\\r\\nBurnside was one of the artists featured in the 2008 documentary film Artists of the Bahamas by Karen Arthur and Tom Neuwirth. ArtReview called Burnside a \"pioneering voice in Afrofuturism\". A portrait of Burnside was created by artist Jamaal Rolle in 2014. Burnside was a consult on pageantry for the 2014 IAAF World Relays.\\r\\nBurnside has exhibited in the United States, France, the Dominican Republic, Bermuda, Cuba, Ecuador, and Venezuela. His 2000 oil painting Solomon commemorates the Bahamian musician Exuma as King Solomon and is part of the collection of the National Art Gallery of The Bahamas.

Burnside\\'s 2022 solo exhibition at the Galerie Perrotin in New York, Stanley Burnside: As Time Goes On, was curated by his mentee, Bahamian conceptual artist Tavares Strachan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSideburns\\r\\nBurnside was hired by The Nassau Guardian to be their editorial cartoonist in July 1979. His comic strip Sideburns ran six days a week in the Guardian for decades except for a brief period where it ran in The Tribune. In 1983 Burnside published a collection of his editorial cartoons entitled Off der top. The best of Sideburns. A cartoon history of contemporary Bahamas.\\r\\nSideburns cartoons were often single-panelled, featuring characters such as the Shack Rat and the Tourism Goose. The editorial cartoons usually addressed topics pertaining to The Bahamas, but also satirized international affairs. In the cartoons, he sketched out social commentary, with his subjects including sports, crime, religion, death, and business. Many of Burnside\\'s comics were political cartoons. In a 1990 interview, he characterized his style as \"poking fun at local political events and characters.\" According to Burnside, his themes cut through the \"froth and zeroes in on the heart of issues\". Burnside has said the size of the Bahamas can potentially be constraining, but \"as long as I have both sides complaining about what I\\'m doing, I\\'m doing okay.\" Sideburns also employed development themes, with Burnside advocating on behalf of vaccination programs, programs to stop drunk driving, and the Heart Foundation.\\r\\nAfter a 40-year run of Sideburns, including more than 10,000 cartoon panels, The Nassau Guardian terminated Burnside\\'s employment in 2019.

Segall\\'s work is derived from impressionism, expressionism and modernism.  His most significant themes were depictions of human suffering, war, persecution and prostitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and education\\r\\nSegall was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, the son of a Torah scribe.\\r\\nSegall moved to Berlin at the age of 15 and studied first at Berlin K�nigliche Akademie der K�nste from 1906 to 1910. At the end of 1910 he moved to Dresden to continue his studies at the Kunstakademie Dresden as a \"Meistersch�ler\".\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nExpressionist Forum\\r\\nSegall published a book of five etchings in Dresden, Sovenirs of Vilna in 1919, and two books illustrated with lithographs titled Bubu and die Sanfte. He then began to express himself more freely and developed his own style, which incorporated aspects of Cubism, while exploring his own Jewish background.  His earlier paintings throughout 1910 to the early 1920s depicted troubled figures surrounded in claustrophobic surroundings with exaggerated and bold features, influenced by African tribal figures.\\r\\nIn 1912 his first painted series of works were conducted in an elderly insane asylum.  Segall\\'s work largely portrayed the masses of persecuted humanity in his Expressionist form.  Later that year, he moved to S�o Paulo, Brazil, where three of his siblings were already living.\\r\\nHe returned to Dresden in 1914 and was still quite active in the Expressionist style. In 1919 Segall founded the \\'Dresdner Sezession Gruppe 1919\\' with Otto Dix, Conrad Felixm�ller, Otto Lange and other artists.  Segall\\'s exhibition at the Galery Gurlitt received multiple awards.  However successful Segall was in Europe, he had already been greatly influenced by his time spent in Brazil, which had already transformed both his style and his subject matter. The visit to Brazil gave Segall the opportunity to obtain a strong idea of South American art and, in turn, made Segall return to Brazil yet again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeginnings in Brazil: Modernist trends\\r\\nThough Segall was still a Russian citizen, he moved back to Brazil in 1923.  Upon Segall\\'s return to S�o Paulo he obtained Brazilian citizenship along with his first wife, Margarete.\\r\\nWhile in Brazil, his paintings were influenced heavily by the Red Light District in Rio de Janeiro.  Many Brazilian artists influenced Segall\\'s subject matter and strengthened his Cubist form.  He became acclimated within his newfound country and painted themes contributing to Brazil\\'s countryside, mulattoes, favelas, prostitutes and plantations. Due to the harsh and extreme nature of Segall\\'s portrayal of prostitutes and his depiction of human suffering, his artwork became controversial.  This particular controversy in his artwork caused he and other well known artists to organize a pro Modernist event known as the Semana de Arte Moderna.\\r\\nIn the year 1922, the Semana de Arte Moderna was organized Segall included, being one of the mainstream forerunners in the art exhibition.  The week-long event included Segall\\'s work, as well as Anita Malfatti\\'s largely controversial artwork.  Not only were paintings included, but performances and other art forms were conducted at the event.  Segall\\'s avant garde innovations ranked him highly among other Brazilian outstanding modern artists during that time, like Candido Portinari and Emiliano Di Cavalcanti.\\r\\nThough Segall had intended to reside exclusively in Brazil, he continued to return and forth to Europe for his own personal exhibitions.  In 1925, Segall became extremely close to his pupil Jenny Klabin and eventually married her.\\r\\n\\r\\nSociedade Pro-Arte Moderna (SPAM)\\r\\nIn 1932, shortly after Segall\\'s multiple visits to Paris and Germany he founded an organization along with other artists known as Sociedade Pro-Arte Moderna (SPAM). The organization was short lived (November 1932 - December 1934).  Similar to the Semana de Arte Moderna, the organization included members of S�o Paulo\\'s earliest modernist forerunners.  SPAM\\'s central idea was to serve as a link between artists, intellectuals, collectors, patrons, and the public as a whole. SPAM was also created to serve as a public environment for vanguard art in Brazil.\\r\\nSPAM consisted of two exhibitions.  The first exhibition showed works from the artists of the School of Paris from multiple S�o Paulo collections which acknowledged Brazilian artists of the time.  The controversial Modernist artist, Tarsila do Amaral, also held her artworks in the exhibition as well as works of local artists such as Anita Malfatti, Victor Brecheret, John Graz, Regina Graz and Rossi Osir. The second half of the exhibition consisted of solely Brazilian artists from S�o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro- such as di Cavalcanti, Ismael Nery, Portinari and Alberto da Veiga Guignard.\\r\\nAlso similar to the Semana de Arte Moderna, two significant \"balls\" were held by the leaders of the organization.  The rooms in which the balls were held were named \"Cidade de SPAM\" (City of SPAM). Though these balls seemed to be fund raising events, they were merely performances to make audiences think about the ever-changing movement in Brazil.  They consisted of live musical acts, dancers, built scenery and artwork and ornate costumes. The sets were meant to portray \"mini towns\", and SPAM even had its own newspapers, anthem and multiple governing bodies.\\r\\nSegall\\'s works included in the SPAM exhibition were two of his most important series of paintings in 1935; Campos do Jordao landscapes and the Portraits of Lucy. Lucy was an understudy pupil and Segall conducted a series of images dedicated to her.  Campos do Jordao landscapes and the Portraits of Lucy depicted the world\\'s outbreak of war, it portrayed genocides and indefinite tragedy.\\r\\nThe organization of SPAM fought for justice yet, disagreements arose between Integralists, known as Brazilian Fascists, that discriminated against foreigners in Brazil, especially Jews.  With this large amount of controversy and intolerable strain on SPAM\\'s membership, the group soon fell apart. A defeated Segall meant that the driving force behind the organization had come to an end.\\r\\n\\r\\nControversy in Europe\\r\\nSegall\\'s work was still gaining much positive credit still in Brazil, despite the dissolution of SPAM. The positive feedback considers Segall one of Brazil\\'s most influential modernist artists. Although, back in Europe, his work was considered degenerate and preposterous. Specifically in Germany, his artwork was no longer able to be shown in exhibits. Fascism was rising quickly in Germany and many believed Segall\\'s work to portray negatively on Europe\\'s economic status due to the largely acknowledged outbreak of war.\\r\\nThis particular negative impact on his artwork then forced Segall to create a series of images of his troubled Jewish childhood and to depict the large number of emigration waves that he grew up with, as well. These images also portrayed universal suffering of human existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater years\\r\\nStill haunted by Rio de Janeiro\\'s Mangue, Segall created images that stayed throughout his late career.  Much of his earlier impact of human suffering led Segall to create one of his most famous artworks in 1939 and 1940, known as Navio de emigrantes (Ship of Emigrants). The image depicts a heavily condensed and large number of people on the dock of a ship.  Although this does not coincide with much of Segall\\'s previous work of human suffering, this provides the audience with a deep depiction of (at the time) the contemporary and controversial waves of emigrants and human affliction and persecution.\\r\\nLater in the mid-1940s, Segall published his series of Mangue drawings that revealed poverty, specifically in the Rio de Janeiro slums.  Becoming wholeheartedly closer to his Brazilian nationality, Segall portrays these images in a stark manner, yet the underprivileged and oppressed images provides a significant cultural identity for the Rio de Janeiro inhabitants.\\r\\nFrom 1949 until his death in 1957, he continued to work on engraving and painting Mangue as well as producing a series entitled Wandering Women and Forests.\\r\\n\\r\\nSubject matter and themes\\r\\nSegall\\'s subject matter was portrayed more subtly and softer in his early career.  He did not depict much of the African influence on his artwork until he moved to Brazil.  It was not until Segall visited Brazil for the first few times, that he branched out towards the Expressionist style.  He was able to express himself in a freer manner while he portrayed the lifelong theme of his Jewish culture depicting the tribulations of European Jews. Although he was a humanist, he never forgot his Jewish roots.\\r\\nSegall\\'s initial paintings in Brazil reflect a strong national connection and passion for his newfound homeland.  He portrayed the landscapes in S�o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and portrayed the different races without tension or malintention. However, Segall remained faithful towards his Cubist nature throughout the majority of his artworks.  Specifically, one of his famous artworks, entitled Banana Plantation, shows a Brazilian banana plantation, thick in density. Segall achieved balance in this painting by centering the worker\\'s neck and head protruding from the bottom of the painting.  This causes the audience to be fully focused towards the center space.  This significant symmetrical balance emphasizes the human element involved in the Brazilian agricultural system. The diminished amount of slavery in Brazil during this time period, the 1920s, abolished Brazilian-Negro slaves and replaced them with an overwhelming number of European workers coming to Brazil.  This particular image portrays the engulfment of the plantations by the Europeans.\\r\\nOther prominent theme in Segall\\'s work is human suffering and emigration.  In another famous artwork of Segall\\'s, entitled Ship of Emigrants, a ship dock is overcrowded and engulfed with emigrant passengers.  Not only does the image portray a dark and saddening emotion, but it significantly portrays the troubled figures aboard the ship. The solemn faces and lack of expression on the passengers blatantly shows the harsh reality of emigrants and their depressing lifestyles of forced moves.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuseu Lasar Segall\\r\\nLasar Segall\\'s home in S�o Paulo is now a museum, furnished with his furniture, books and plants, as well  his most famous works. It is also a non-profit organization respected highly among the community of S�o Paulo.\\r\\nMuseu Lasar Segall is also a center for the art community in S�o Paulo to participate in monitored cultural activities regularly. Art classes such as photography, engraving and the study of film are held in Segall\\'s home. Also incorporated in the Museum is a large, highly acclaimed art library that holds specific books directed towards photography and the arts of spectacle.\\r\\nThe Museu Lasar Segall is preserved to explore the stimulating experiences within multiple forms of art while still keeping a Brazilian cultural identity. The form of art conducted in Brazil is of one entirely different than other art forms. The Museum is intact today because of Brazil\\'s concern to maintain their strong nationality and to preserve Lasar Segall\\'s culturally influenced art dedicated for Brazil.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\nMarch 1913 solo exhibition in S�o Paulo; June 1913 solo exhibition in Campinas\\r\\n1920 large solo exhibition at the Museum Folkwang in Hagen; solo exhibition at the Schames Gallery in Frankfurt\\r\\n1922 takes part in International Art Exhibition in D�sseldorf\\r\\n1924 solo exhibition in S�o Paulo\\r\\n1926 exhibition at the Galerie Nierendorf, Berlin and another exhibition at Neue Kunst Fides Gallery, Dresden\\r\\n1927 solo exhibition in S�o Paulo\\r\\n1928 solo exhibition at the Rio Palace Hotel, Rio de Janeiro\\r\\n1935 takes part in the International Painting Exhibition at Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh\\r\\n1937 ten of his works are shown at the Nazi- Sponsored Degenerate Art Exhibition, Munich\\r\\n1938 solo exhibition at Renou et Colle Gallery, Paris\\r\\n1945 takes part in the exhibition Art Condemned by the Third Reich, Askanazy Gallery, Rio de Janeiro\\r\\n1948 solo exhibition at Associated American Artists Galleries, New York\\r\\n\\r\\nList of artworks\\r\\ntres jovens 1939, bronze sculpture, pinacoteca, Sao Paulo, Brazil\\r\\nOs eternos caminhantes (The Eternal Wanderers), 1919, oil on canvas, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\nNude Female Bust, 1920, pencil sketch, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\nBanana Plantation, 1927, oil on canvas, State Picture Gallery, S�o Paulo\\r\\nBrazilian Landscape, 1927, watercolor, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\nThe Third Class, 1928, drypoint on paper, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\nRua do Mangue (Street of Mangue), 1928, drypoint and etching on paper, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\nPrimeira classe (First Class), 1929, drypoint and etching on paper, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\nEmigrantes (Emigrants), 1929, drypoint on paper, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\nFavela (Shantytown), 1930, drypoint on paper, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\nFigura feminina reclinada (Reclining Woman), 1930, oil on canvas, Private Collection, S�o Paulo\\r\\nNavio de emigrantes (Ship of Emigrants), 1939�1940, oil with sand on canvas, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\nWoman from the \\'Mangue\\' with Persiennes, 1942, woodcut on Japanese paper, Museu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n Media related to Lasar Segall at Wikimedia Commons\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks by or about Lasar Segall at Internet Archive\\r\\nMuseu Lasar Segall, S�o Paulo (English version).\\r\\nMuseo de Frida Kahlo, Mexico City (English version).', 'Manuel Corchado y Juarbe (September 12, 1840 – November 30, 1884) was a Puerto Rican poet, journalist and politician who defended the abolition of slavery and the establishment of a university in Puerto Rico. Through his written works he criticized the way the people of Puerto Rico were being treated by the island\\'s Spanish-appointed governor.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly years\\r\\nCorchado y Juarbe was born in Arenales Altos, a barrio in the town of Isabela in Puerto Rico. His parents were Juan Eugenio Corchado and Juana Eugenia Juarbe. He received his primary education in the towns of Isabela and Aguadilla. In 1855, his parents sent him to Barcelona, Spain, where he received and finished his secondary education. Corchado y Juarbe later earned a law degree from the University of Barcelona.\\r\\nWhile living in Barcelona, Corchado y Juarbe, together with José Coll y Britapaja, a fellow Puerto Rican, founded a magazine called \"Las Antillas\". He used the magazine to make public the social problems in Puerto Rico and what the people of the island were going through. He championed the idea of the establishment of a university and the abolition of slavery. Corchado y Juarbe also criticized and told of the abuses of Lieutenant General Féliz María de Messina Iglesias, the Spanish-appointed governor in the island.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturn to Puerto Rico\\r\\nCorchado y Juarbe returned to Puerto Rico and began a column in the newspaper \"El Agente\". In 1862, he entered a contest sponsored by the Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País de Puerto Rico (the Economic Society of Friends of the Country of Puerto Rico). The \"Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País de Puerto Rico\" was a branch of the \"Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País\", and these were private associations established in various cities throughout Spain and, to a lesser degree, in some of her colonies. In the contest, Corchado y Juarbe won first prize for his poem \"Oda a Campeche\". His poem was published in various Spanish newspapers and magazines. Corchado y Juarbe also presided over the Ateneo Puertorriqueño (Puerto Rican Athenaeum) for some time.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish Courts\\r\\nCorchado y Juarbe was a supporter of the Spanish Revolución of 1868, believing that the Spanish colonies will enjoy more liberties with the establishment of the new regime. In 1871, after the success of the revolution, which established a republican government, he was elected to represent the District of Mayagüez and Puerto Rico before the Spanish Courts in Barcelona. Corchado y Juarbe made use of his position to denounce the use of capital punishment and voice his support of the new Spanish Constitution. He also delivered speeches in which he favored the improvement of social and economic conditions for the Spanish colonies. In 1875, the Spanish royal family returned to power and Corchado y Juarbe decided that it was too dangerous to continue in his political quest. In 1879, he returned to Puerto Rico.\\r\\nIn 1881, he moved to the city of Ponce because of health problems and continued writing for \"El Agente\" where he expressed his views. He then became a member of the new Reformist Party and ran for the position of representative to the Spanish Courts for said party. He was elected to represent the District of Aguadilla and returned to Spain.\\r\\nCorchado y Juarbe made many enemies because of his views and was accused of electoral fraud. He defended the legality of his election to represent Puerto Rico before the Spanish Courts to no avail. Corchado y Juarbe returned to Madrid and was challenged to a gun duel. He accepted the challenge and on November 30, 1884, died of the wounds received. Moments before he died, he told his wife the following:\\r\\n\\r\\nTell them my name, that I accomplished the mission of sacrificing my life for my country.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegacy\\r\\nCorchado y Juarbe\\'s body was buried in Madrid. In 1935, a committee of local citizens was formed to return his body to Isabela and to erect a monument to honor his memory and life. As a result, in 1993, his remains were transferred from Madrid to Isabela and interred in the local cemetery.\\r\\nPuerto Rican poet José Gualberto Padilla dedicated a poem to the memory of Corchado y Juarbe titled \"En la muerte de Corchado\". A school, a street and the city square in his hometown, Isabela are named after him. On July 17, 1998, the Puerto Rican Legislature passed and approved Law 132 which designates the week beginning September 12 as \"Manuel Corchado y Juarbe week\".\\r\\n\\r\\nWritten works\\r\\nAmong Corchado y Juarbe\\'s written works are the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Biografía de Lincoln\" (Abraham Lincoln)\\r\\n\"Historia de Ultratumba\"\\r\\n\"Oda a Campeche\" (Jose Campeche)\\r\\n\"Las Barricadas\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\n\\r\\nList of Puerto Ricans\\r\\nList of Puerto Rican writers\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Brett Murray (born 1961) is a South African artist mostly known for his steel and mixed media wall sculptures. He was born in Pretoria, South Africa. Murray has a master\\'s degree in fine art from the Michaelis School of Fine Art, 1989. Referred to by critic Brenda Atkinson as \"the dark prince of South African pop (art)\", Murray is one of the country\\'s most popular artists, often using easily recognisable media images with the addition of a subversive and bitterly funny twist. Murray\\'s work addresses the wars of the cultures, the clash between Afrocentrism and Eurocentrism, the old and the new South Africas.  \"With my work I hope to critically entertain. Through satirical and tragic reflections on South Africa, I hope to shift people\\'s perspectives and change people\\'s minds, indulgent, arrogant and pretentious as this might sound,\" he says.  More recently, his work has explored his own personal experiences and identity. Murray was also the founder of the sculpture department at Stellenbosch University.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefamation suit\\r\\nIn 2012, Murray exhibited a painting in a Johannesburg gallery of then-president Jacob Zuma with his genitals exposed, titled The Spear. The painting was part of a show of political work entitled \"Hail to the Thief II\". On 18 May, the African National Congress announced its intention to sue him for defamation for the painting and to force the gallery to remove it from exhibition, its website, and printed materials. Many public figures expressed outrage at the painting, and one church even called for Murray to be \"stoned to death\".\\r\\nOn Tuesday 22 May 2012, at 11am two men walked into the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg with pots of paint and defaced The Spear. They were caught on camera by a news team and were apprehended immediately by gallery security.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the defamation debate, comparisons were drawn between Murray\\'s The Spear and fellow South African Ayanda Mabulu\\'s work from 2010, Ngcono ihlwempu kunesibhanxo sesityebi. The painting depicts Jacob Zuma in similar fashion alongside Desmond Tutu, Nelson Mandela and other figures from the anti-Apartheid struggle - several sources questioned the potential racial and political motivations in Zuma\\'s attack on Murray, a white artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollections\\r\\nIziko, South African National Gallery, Cape Town, SA\\r\\nJohannesburg Art Gallery, SA\\r\\nDurban Art Gallery, SA\\r\\nTatham Art Gallery, Pietermaritzburg, SA\\r\\nUniversity of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\nUniversity of Cape Town, SA\\r\\nUniversity of South Africa, Pretoria, SA\\r\\nUniversity of Bloemfontein, SA\\r\\nSandton Municipality, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\nDirectAxis Collection, Cape Town, SA\\r\\nBHP Billiton Collection, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\nMTN Collection, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\nSasol Collection, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\nSouth African Breweries, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\nSouth African Broadcasting Corporation, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\nThe South African Reserve Bank, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\nVodacom Collection, Cape Town, SA\\r\\nNando’s Art Collection, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\nSindika Dokolo African Collection of Contemporary Art, Luanda, Angola\\r\\nRed Bull, Salzburg, Austria\\r\\nCollection of Mikki and Stanley Weithorn, USA\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected exhibitions\\r\\n2010 Spier Contemporary, Stellenbosch, SA\\r\\n2009 Crocodile Tears, Goodman Gallery, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\n2008 Crocodile Tears, Goodman Gallery Cape, Cape Town, SA\\r\\n2006 Sleep Sleep, The Goodman Gallery, Johannesburg, SA and João Ferreira Gallery, Cape Town, SA\\r\\n2003 Us and Them, Axis Gallery, New York, USA\\r\\n2002 Standard Bank Young Artist of the Year Award exhibition, White Like Me, travelling to: National Arts Festival, Grahamstown, SA\\r\\nKing George VI Art Gallery, Port Elizabeth, SA\\r\\nJohannes Stegman Art Gallery, Bloemfontein, SA\\r\\n2001 Hero, Bell-Roberts Contemporary, Cape Town, SA\\r\\n2000 I Love Africa, Bell-Roberts Contemporary, Cape Town, SA and The Goodman Gallery, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\n1997 Own, Hänel Gallery, Cape Town, SA and The Goodman Gallery, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\n1996 Brett Murray: New Sculptures, Gallery Frank Hänel, Frankfurt, Germany\\r\\n1996 White Boy Sings the Blues, Rembrandt van Rijn Gallery, Johannesburg, SA\\r\\n1995 Venice Biennale\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards and merits\\r\\n2007 Finalist, Spier Contemporaries\\r\\n2002 Winner, collaboration with the late Stefaans Samcuia, Cape Town International Convention Centre, Public Art Competition\\r\\n1998 Winner, Cape Town Urban Art Foundation, Sculpture Competition\\r\\n1992 Finalist, Cape Town Urban Art Foundation, Sculpture Competition\\r\\n1992 Finalist, Waterfront Sculpture Competition, Cape Town\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Gamal al-Ghitani (Arabic: جمال الغيطانى, IPA: [ɡæˈmæːl el ɣeˈtˤɑːni]; 9 May 1945 – 18 October 2015) was an Egyptian author of historical and political novels and cultural and political commentaries and was the editor-in-chief of the literary periodical Akhbar Al-Adab (\"Cultural News\") till 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife and works\\r\\nGamal al-Ghitani was born in Juhaynah, Sohag Governorate in Upper Egypt and moved with his family to Cairo as a child.

The program is a parody of 60 Minutos, a controversial news program broadcast on the same channel throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

The two met again in 1995, when they produced programs such as Plan Z and El Factor Humano for the Chilean television channel Rock & Pop. But, contrary to their expectations, neither production prospered. In addition, the channel ceased broadcasting on December 1, 1999, leaving both Peirano and Diaz unemployed.\\r\\nTo get out of this situation, they founded the production company Aplaplac together with Juan Manuel Egaña. Initially, Aplaplac developed two programs: Sangre, sudor y lágrimas (Blood, Sweat and Tears), —a human-interest program bought by the sports channel PSN—, and Mira tú (Look at You), a cultural program produced with funds from the Consejo Nacional de Televisión in 2001 and broadcast by Televisión Nacional de Chile in 2002.\\r\\nMira tú stood out for its quality and became the production company\\'s letter of introduction, therefore Díaz, Peirano and Egaña applied for a second time to a CNTV competition fund in 2002, this time in the children\\'s television category. The project presented was entitled El gabinete del Doctor Mojado (The Wet Doctor\\'s Cabinet), and in it a fish was conducting a television program from a fishbowl. In one of its segments, a puppet reported on what was happening with the excrements in the treatment plants. Aplaplac won the contest and obtained funds to produce 21 episodes that would be broadcast on Televisión Nacional de Chile. The idea evolved into a puppet and marionette news show called \"31 minutos\" -—a name that originated from the contest rules, which mentioned that the projects had to last half an hour—.\\r\\nAt the same time, Peirano worked at the Chilean newspaper El Mercurio, where he met the artist Rodrigo Salinas, who -together with the artists Daniel Castro and Matias Iglesis- formed the art collective La nueva gráfica chilena. Peirano invited them to be part of the production team for 31 minutos, leaving Salinas and Castro as scriptwriters —along with Díaz and Peirano—, Iglesis as art director —establishing the visual identity of the program and its characters— and Juan Manuel Egaña as executive producer of Aplaplac and 31 minutos. Due to requirements from TVN, a stable female character had to be included in the episodes. The actress and comedian Alejandra Dueñas —known from La nueva gráfica chilena— later joined the team, giving life to Patana\\'s character.\\r\\nThe conviction of their creators at the beginning was to make a type of television program that they would have liked to see as children. They were fully aware that minors no longer consumed only programs that were aimed at a child audience and, based on that, came to the idea that a satire of the news had to be made. The idea also arose of inventing songs and presenting them in a musical classification. To that end, Peirano —who shared friendship with the members of the Chilean funk rock group Chancho en Piedra— introduced Pablo Ilabaca —guitarist of that band—, who brought with him a compact disc of tracks without lyrics, with which he didn\\'t know what to do. The first instrumental Díaz and Peirano heard was the one that later became the central theme of 31 minutos, of which they quickly became fond. The rest of the tracks were used for the soundtrack of the episodes, along with other songs invented by the team. Ilabaca remained as the music producer for 31 minutos, giving rise to the Ranking Top segment, of which the character Policarpo Avendaño —interpreted by Daniel Castro— is in charge.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuccess and internationalization\\r\\n31 minutos made its debut on March 15, 2003. Its first episodes marked 6 points of screen rating, but as time went on it began to popularize and increase its audience to an average of 14 points. Initially it was a news show of interest to children, however, as the program progressed in its first season, it went from being a parody of news to becoming a character comedy. In view of the popularity achieved by the program in 2003, the creators agreed to produce a second and third season, this time with funds from the channel.\\r\\nPart of the program\\'s success lies in its script and characters, with hidden references to Chile\\'s social reality. It has also been successful among young and adult audiences: the double entendre that it handles is manifested, for example, in the fact that the puppets are ironic imitations of real Chilean television characters, and recall events or television events that characterized Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.\\r\\nThe commercial success of the program was reflected in the appearance of several products based on it. On July 8, 2003, a studio album called 31 minutos was released, with the songs that were part of the musical classification of the first season of the program. It naturally sold out all its copies in less than a day and came to sell more than 200,000 copies. Not only was an album released, but on July 28, 2004, there was a release of 31 canciones de amor y una canción de Guaripolo, which included the songs of the second season. The name of the album refers to the book Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada by Pablo Neruda. Its premiere took place in the Paseo Ahumada in Santiago and, despite not surpassing the phenomenon achieved by its predecessor, in one week it sold 20,000 copies and achieved the position of platinum record. The songs of the third season were compiled in the album Ratoncitos -in which the musician Angelo Pierattini-, which was awarded a gold record a few days after its release. In addition to the records with the songs of the program, near Christmas 2003 the home videos Lo mejor de 31 minutos and Los Policarpo Top Top Top Awards were released, which together sold more than 35,000 records. This fact made them the best selling local DVDs in the history of Chile.\\r\\nThe popularity obtained with the program has led its characters to be part of publicity and propagandistic campaigns in Chile. For example, Tulio and Bodoque appeared in commercial messages on the transport system of Santiago de Chile, Transantiago, to educate people on how to behave on the buses. In 2010, UNICEF released a commercial entitled \"Rearmemos la vida de niños y niñas\" (Let\\'s revive the lives of children) with the aim of raising morale after the 2010 Chile earthquake. These ads show Tulio talking about the fear he feels from the tremors, but his friends from the news encourage him by telling him that together everything is better and that it is normal to feel fear. Another ad with UNICEF was about short films showing musical numbers in which Patana gives Tulio advice on how to prevent influenza. In addition, since 2015, Mario Hugo has been the face of the Santiago Metropolitan Regional Government\\'s campaign entitled \"Cuidado con el perro\" (Be careful with your dog), which calls for sterilization, responsible ownership and care of dogs in public spaces.\\r\\nThe second season of 31 minutos made its debut on March 20, 2004 on Televisión Nacional de Chile, and simultaneously the program began to be known in other countries. On June 9, 2004, Nickelodeon\\'s Latin American signal bought the first two seasons of the series, and premiered them on September 17 of the same year. The network broadcast the episodes until 2007. Thanks to Nickelodeon\\'s children\\'s audience, the program became internationalized, with good reception in countries such as Mexico and Brazil —where it was dubbed into Portuguese— On June 19, 2005, the third season began to be broadcast on TVN, consisting of only 15 episodes.\\r\\nMexico was the first country other than Chile to broadcast the series on open television when it premiered in 2006 on Canal 11. Thanks to Canal 11\\'s broadcasting, in 2007 the EMI label released the album 31 minutos for the first time in Mexico. Both events made 31 minutos a popular hit in the country. Ro Velázquez —a member of the Mexican group Liquits— came up with the idea of producing a tribute album for the program in which fanatical artists chose their favorite song to record in their own way. The project became official with the release of \"La regla primordial\" —from the album Ratoncitos— versioned by Tepetokio (a duo formed by Mexican singer Rubén Albarrán and his wife Psykini) as a single. The tribute was named Yo nunca vi televisión and was published in December 2009 under the label Terricolas imbéciles. In it, fourteen Chilean and Mexican artists performed some songs from the first three albums of 31 minutos. Yo nunca vi televisión was distributed in Mexico and the southern United States, and sold about 5,000 copies in its first weeks. In addition to its physical version, it was uploaded to the iTunes store for downloading.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheater plays and concerts\\r\\nAt the end of 2010, 31 minutos performed a play called Resucitando una estrella (\"Resuscitating a Star\"). The plot revolved around a television talent show, where Tulio Triviño and other characters were looking for the best old-fashioned artist to give them the chance to be again. These performances began as a tour of southern Chile to bring joy to people in the localities most devastated by the earthquake of February 27 that year,  but some time later the play arrived in Mexico, in 2012.On March 31, 2012 they performed at the Lollapalooza Chile festival. Juan Manuel Egaña received an invitation and, together with Felipe Ilabaca —bass player of Chancho en Piedra—, convinced Díaz and Peirano to participate —who, at first, considered the event as a humorous one—  It was such an impact that the band (composed by the musicians Pablo Ilabaca on the electric guitar, Felipe Ilabaca on the bass, Camilo Salinas on the keyboards and Pedropiedra on the drums, together with the voice actors of the program) scheduled four presentations for July in the Movistar Arena of Santiago.  These events were very well attended and popular,  in addition to being released on a live album called Gira Mundial —under the label Feria Music—.  In the second half of 2012 the Organizing Committee of the 2013 Viña del Mar International Song Festival confirmed 31 minutos as one of the national artists for the journey. They performed on February 27, 2013,  being the first puppet group to set foot in the Quinta Vergara. In more than an hour and a half of presentation they achieved a show that was praised by the press and applauded by the audience present,  which gave them the 4 maximum awards of the evening. They also achieved the maximum position of tune of the 2013 edition of the festival: 53 points of screen share.  Coinciding with the same day of the presentation, the company Amnesia Games developed a game of 31 minutos for cellular phones in alliance with the producer Aplaplac and the telephone company Claro Chile.  The game stood out in the stores of Windows Phone and Amazon and managed to position itself in the first places of the App Store.\\r\\nIn view of the success achieved at the festival, they decided to play the stages again, but this time with Radio Guaripolo, a show directed by Alvaro Diaz and written by Pedro Peirano, which officially opened at the Teatro Municipal de Las Condes.  In it, Guaripolo owns a radio station, where he plays pranks on the phone to the rest of the characters of 31 minutos.  One of the most important events of this production was the premiere of the song \"Mi mamá me lo teje todo\", which would later be part of the soundtrack of the fourth season.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth season and present\\r\\nIn addition, after nine years of absence, 31 minutos announced its return to television, according to an interview given by Aplaplac to the Chilean newspaper La Tercera. The fourth season began its recordings in 2013 and was broadcast on TVN. In addition, the program again won a fund from the CNTV to finance it. The team underwent restructuring, such as the change of Juan Manuel Egaña —who became Manager of Management and Development of Chilevisión— to Alejandra Neumann in the executive production of Aplaplac and the series, and the performance of Juanín, who although dubbed by Salinas did not participate as a puppeteer in the recordings, so the actor Héctor Velozo had to take his place. Salinas only brought his characters to life live in the presentation at the 2013 Viña del Mar Festival.\\r\\nThis season\\'s premiere was on October 4, 2014, viewed for the first time in HD (16:9) format. The first episode marked 9.3 points of screen share, but was surpassed by the program Morandé con compañía of the Chilean television channel Mega —which obtained more than 15—. It ended the night of December 27, 2014 after a cycle of twelve episodes. Despite the low results it obtained on Televisión Nacional de Chile, from October 2015 it was bought and transmitted by the Cartoon Network signal to Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, and then began to be broadcast to all of Latin America by Boomerang. On January 5, 2020 it was added to Netflix Latin America.\\r\\nDuring the premiere of the fourth season\\'s chapters, 31 minutos adapted their 2003 Christmas special to a montage entitled Calurosa Navidad, with which they performed during the month of December at the Centro de las Artes 660 in Las Condes. The program had already established itself as a band, and Díaz and Peirano decided to focus their future on touring and live concerts. During 2015, they prepared a play based on William Shakespeare\\'s Romeo and Juliet, which was presented in January 2016 as part of the Santiago a Mil International Festival. It was then shown at venues such as the Teatro Municipal de Las Condes in April 2016 and the Teatro Oriente de Providencia in July of the same year. It again participated in the 2017 version of the Santiago a Mil International Festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn September 12, 2015, Aplaplac independently released the album Arwrarwrirwrarwro —where the songs of the fourth season are located—. The album had a pre-sale in Mexico, in July of the same year, during a presentation of Radio Guaripolo. Pablo Ilabaca and Álvaro Díaz were in charge of its production, but it had the support of Felipe Ilabaca, Camilo Salinas and Pedropiedra in the instruments.\\r\\nOn the other hand, Radio Guaripolo performed for the last time at the Festival Osorno de la Leche y la Carne, on January 30, 2016. For the tour in Mexico 2016, Aplaplac released Tremendo Tulio Tour, a parody of the tributes of artists for their careers, where they give one to Tulio Triviño. The success of the tour led them to play live for the first time in Argentina and Colombia. The first performance took place at the Usina del Arte in Buenos Aires on April 21, 2018. This was the last show in which Pedropiedra participated as drummer for 31 minutos, so Leonardo Corvalán —drummer for Chancho en Piedra— took his place. The second was at the Festival Rock al Paque in Bogotá on June 30, 2019, with three performances on the same day.\\r\\nIn January 2019, a fifth studio album was confirmed, without relying on the music of a season. To promote it, the first single was \"Ritmo sideral\", released on October 11, 2019. It was followed by \"Perro chico\" and \"Lucía, la sandía\", which appeared on November 22, 2019 and January 17, 2020, respectively. On November 20, 2019, the organizers of the Mexican festival Vive Latino released the line-up for its 21st edition, where it highlighted 31 minutos with a double performance, on March 14 and 15, 2020 with a special show. They named the show Yo nunca vi televisión —like the homonymous song on the first album of 31 minutos—, and in it they recreated the format of a newscast —like in the TV series— and played a repertoire of songs of which \"Ritmo sideral\" and \"Perro chico\" were part. During February 2020 a tour in Mexico was scheduled in which Yo nunca vi televisión was to perform during March in the cities of San Luis Potosí, Guadalajara and Mérida, but to prevent contagion from the COVID-19 pandemic it was decided to reschedule the dates for October of the following year. Of the original presentations, 31 minutos could only be presented on both days at the Vive Latino festival. The crisis caused by this disease was the reason for 31 minutos to join for the third time with UNICEF to launch the \"Cuarentena 31\" campaign, with the aim of addressing issues that affect children during confinement. The capsules were broadcast on Cartoon Network and Boomerang Latinoamécica, and on July 29, 2020, a song entitled \"Primavera\" was launched to encourage people in the midst of the health crisis. On September 1, 2020, UNICEF named 31 minutos as Goodwill Ambassadors for UNICEF Chile.\\r\\nDíaz and Peirano have stated on multiple occasions that it is not possible to make a fifth season for Chilean television, because this is not a format where the program can remain —adding to this the high costs of production—. The reinvention through tours, new songs and records has been key to the validity of the franchise. In any case, none of them have ruled out the possibility of making it on streaming platforms, according to the interest of these.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacters\\r\\n31 minutos is conducted by Tulio Triviño Tufillo, a millionaire gray chimpanzee who is self-centered, but ignorant and short on understanding. He is the best friend of Juan Carlos Bodoque, a red rabbit. He is the program\\'s star journalist and is in charge of the environmental section La Nota Verde. He is moody, bohemian, witty, an occasional poet, a womanizer, but above all, a great gambler addicted to horse racing and betting at the hippodrome. Juanín Juan Harry is the studio\\'s general producer, but on the other hand the only survivor of his species, the Juanines. He loves his work and everyone is aware that he is the one who does everything. Policarpo Avendaño is the entertainment commentator, owner of the music segment Ranking Top. Mario Hugo is an absent-minded reporter, owner of many dogs. He is madly in love with Patana Tufillo, a young intern journalist, who is also Tulio\\'s niece. This team is joined by Calcetín con Rombos Man, the superhero defender of children\\'s rights, and Guaripolo, who calls himself the \"favorite character of kids of 31 minutos\", although nobody knows him.\\r\\n\\r\\nDub\\r\\nDespite being mostly broadcast in Latin American countries in their original language, 31 minutos has been dubbed for broadcast in other countries. The first two seasons of the program were dubbed into Portuguese by Nickelodeon under the studio Alamo for broadcast in Brazil during 2004 and 2007, and later season four in the studio Unidub (with the same actors) for Netflix Brazil.  A pilot dubbed into Spanish from Europe was shown to Spanish channels in 2004, however, it was not until 2008 that the series was broadcast in Spain through the VeoTV channel, but with its original audio. A fragment of episode fifteen of the second season (Hielito) was also shown in Holland as a segment within another show, and its dubbing was done by the comedian Niels van der Laan, who played all the characters.\\r\\n\\r\\nFilm\\r\\nSince the success of their first season, Diaz and Peirano had a much larger project in mind, a film of 31 minutos. This began to be developed after the completion of the third season\\'s production.  The incidental music was provided by Pablo Ilabaca and Angelo Pierattini —who had already worked together on the album of the third season Ratoncitos—. The recordings began in Chile in October 2006 and ended in the summer of 2007 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil —where the production company Total Entertainment joined in to provide the cinematic experience that Aplaplac did not have—. However, the post-production and sound process delayed the film, with things like a telephone casting to choose the voices of Tulio, Bodoque, and Juanín in their childhood. In September 2007, Peirano went to review the co-production in Spain. Because he was not carrying cash, he was not allowed into the country, which he was able to enter only after the intervention of the Chilean embassy.\\r\\nFinally the series was brought to the big screen under the name of 31 minutos, la película, and was released in Chile on March 27, 2008, in Mexico on October 16, 2009 and in Brazil on August 3, 2012. With this film the series was given a temporary end. In total, 210,000 spectators attended to see the film in Chile. Despite being praised, it did not collect what it cost to produce it, which led Aplaplac into an economic crisis for two years, and its members had to work on other projects. In addition, they were affected by a robbery at the production company\\'s offices.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpin-offs\\r\\nAplaplac has produced several mini-series with the characters of 31 minutos. As a project for the National Museum of Dentistry of the University of Chile, the production company made a four-episode web series called Las muelas de Guaripolo, in which this character appears teaching the public information about dental hygiene and its history. Together with Las muelas de Guaripolo, in 2017, 31 minutos in collaboration with the Ministry of Health of Chile made the web series La nube de humo. This mini-series consists of three chapters of four to five minutes and deals with how Juan Carlos Bodoque —already retired from journalism— decides to fall into Ramona\\'s requests to do a report on air pollution in Chile.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn July 11, 2009, Las vacaciones de Tulio, Patana y el pequeño Tim premiered on TVN. The program —which consists of 12 episodes— is designed as a spin-off of 31 minutos, that is, a production derived from some of its characters; and the one chosen was precisely Tulio Triviño, the self-centered news anchor who now moves to his lavish summer cabin with his niece Patana and Tim, a friend of hers. The stay is boring, so Tulio entertains his little companions by telling them stories, and so each chapter begins. It is worth mentioning that Juan Carlos Bodoque is also present in Tulio\\'s stories giving ecological advice.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiscography\\r\\n31 minutos (2003)\\r\\n31 canciones de amor y una canción de Guaripolo (2004)\\r\\nRatoncitos (2005)\\r\\nGira mundial (en vivo) (2012)\\r\\nArwrarwrirwrarwro (2015)\\r\\n\\r\\nLive shows\\r\\nResucitando una estrella (Resurrecting a star).\\r\\nTuliopalooza.\\r\\nGira mundial (World tour).\\r\\nFestival de Triviña (performance at the Festival de la canción de Viña del Mar 2013).\\r\\nRadio Guaripolo.\\r\\nCalurosa navidad (Hot Christmas).\\r\\nRomeo y Julieta (Romeo and Juliet).\\r\\nTremendo Tulio Tour.\\r\\nYo nunca vi televisión (I never watched TV).\\r\\nDon Quijote (Don Quixote).\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards, nominations and distinctions\\r\\n2003\\r\\n\\r\\nSpanish American Prix Jeunesse Award, in the category Best Childhood TV Show for 6 - 11 years non-fiction, and TV Show chosen by children.\\r\\nTV-Grama Award in the category Best Childhood TV Show.\\r\\nChile\\'s Circle of Reviewer Award, in the category Television.\\r\\n 2004\\r\\n\\r\\nAward given by the School of Communication Studies, Film and TV from UNIACC University to 31 minutos by Creative Contribution to Chilean TV.\\r\\nOnly nominee and winner category Contribution to the TV in Apes awards.\\r\\nWinner of Altazor award in the categories Rock popular music, Graphic design and illustration, TV Show Direction and Script.\\r\\nThe organization Actitud Animal and the Chilean Federation of Animal Protection Institutions given an award to Juan Carlos Bodoque by to teach how care and guard different species.\\r\\n4th place in the category Light Entertainment of Prix Jeunesse Internacional.\\r\\nWas nominated to Inte Awards in the category Infantil TV Show of the Year.\\r\\nNominated to International Emmy Award in the category Children & Young People.\\r\\n2009\\r\\n\\r\\nChoral Award in the Animation category of the Havana Film Festival for 31 minutos, la película.\\r\\n2013\\r\\n\\r\\nAntorcha de Plata, Antorcha de Oro, Gaviota de Plata and Gaviota de Oro in the LIV Viña del Mar International Song Festival.\\r\\n2016\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the 2016 Pulsar Awards the program was nominated in three categories for its album Arwrarwrirwrarwro, for Best Children Artist, Artist of the Year and Album of the Year.\\r\\n2018\\r\\n\\r\\nWinner of the Indigo Awards 2018, in the Best Live Show category.\\r\\n2019\\r\\n\\r\\nThe website Rave recognized 31 minutos as the Best Chilean production in the history, based on IMDb statistics —with a rating of 8.4—.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nSpitting Image - A British satirical puppet show.\\r\\nPlan Z (TV Show) - Earlier TV show created by many of the same participants.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nOfficial site (in Spanish)\\r\\n31 minutos at IMDb', '', 'Manuel Pereira da Silva (7 December 1920 – 2003) was a Portuguese sculptor.

His novel \"The Amethyst Villa\" won the Literature Prize of the city of Asunci�n in 2004. \"Esperando al Quebrantahuesos\", his fifth novel, was published in 2019. His most recent academic publications are focused on the globalised \"education industry\", redefining the accounting identity of \"educational capital\", by introducing the novel category of \"prestige capital\". They also propose the concept of \"the teacher as the modern Sisyphus\", within the context of the prisoner\\'s dilemma approach, in order to capture the increasing constraints and ethical issues overwhelming the modern teacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation and career\\r\\nHe was born in Tebicuary, district of Coronel Mart�nez, Guair� on January 24, 1953, a descendant of German and Swiss-German families who migrated to Paraguay in the late nineteenth century. He spent his childhood in his hometown, and then moved to Asunci�n where he attended primary and secondary education at the Colegio de Goethe, Asunci�n. He studied economics at the National University of Asunci�n and sociology at the Catholic University of Asunci�n in 1972. A student leader in the fight against the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner in the early Seventies, he took refuge in Buenos Aires in 1974. In 1981 he earned a master\\'s degree in economics from Birkbeck College. In 1986 he received the Ph.D. at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He undertook his doctoral work first under the supervision of Hla Myint, on economic development, and then of Colin Lewis on economic \\r\\nhistory.  Between 1985 and 1986 he participated in the Advanced Studies Program in International Economics of the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, University of Kiel, Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalism\\r\\nHis career in journalism began in 1968, writing for different student publications at the time of the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner; among others, in the weekly Frente, as well as radio and television (\"New Generation\", 1970). Collaborated with the Paraguayan news magazine Di�logo, and in 1974 he worked with different agencies and media based in Buenos Aires, including Inter Press Service, and became a correspondent for Latin American Newsletters , London, in 1975. In 1977, he moved to London where he worked as an editor and journalist (1977�1980) of Latin American Newsletters Ltd, and was editor-in.chief of Informe Semanal, first Spanish version of the newsletters of the British company. Between 1982 and 1984 he was a regular contributor to many newspapers in Latin America, through the Agencia Latinoamerica, based in Miami, Florida, US\\r\\n\\r\\nEconomics\\r\\nHe was an economist in the department of developing countries for the American company Data Resources, McGraw Hill, London and Boston (1985), specializing in the construction of macro-econometric models, among others Algeria and South Africa Between 1986 and 1987 he was a researcher at the Institute of World Economics, Kiel Institute for the World Economy, in Kiel, Germany. Much of his academic bibliography focuses on economic growth, development strategies, labour market and migration, and new global corporations, as well as Latin American economies, particularly Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. His contributions on economics are reputed to have been influenced by John Maynard Keynes and Hla Myint, while those on economic history by Fernand Braudel.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory\\r\\nOne of his first essays published on the history of Paraguay and South America was Capitalist Development, Expansion and Brazilian Political Process in Paraguay, 1975. Once based in London, he undertook an extensive research in British archives, particularly Foreign Office materials, and in libraries in France and Germany; a first result was Britain and the War of the Triple Alliance (1864�1970), published in 1983, and written together with his then wife, Maria Isabel Gimenez of Herken (1954�1998).\\r\\nHis work provides information that allows a critical reevaluation of the context and causes of the great South American war of the nineteenth century, which opposed Paraguay to. Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, and generated strong arguments for the rejection of some of the \"revisionist\" theses on the inescapable contradiction between the \"Paraguayan model\" and British interests. In a letter, dated 11 October 1983, to the authors, the Paraguayan historian Carlos Pastore, describes the work as \"... the first book on the development of this war which I started reading, and also finished.

He is regarded as a cultural pioneer as well as the \"Father of Dominican History.\" He was the author of \"Compendium of History of Santo Domingo\", published in four volumes in 1867, 1887, 1900 and 1906 respectively, and made numerous contributions in the fields of culture, literature and education.\\r\\nHe was the founder of the first Dominican university, the Professional Institute (today University of Santo Domingo), co-founder of the country\\'s first private printing and publishing company, Garcia Hermanos, and founder of the country\\'s first cultural society, \"Los Amantes de las Letras\" (\"Lovers of the Letters\"), responsible for establishing the first Dominican theatre and publishing the first Dominincan cultural newspaper, \"El Oasis\", as well as the first Dominican magazine.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nJosé Gabriel García was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on January 13, 1834, to priest Gabriel Rudesindo Costa (Toso) Ramírez (March 1, 1798 – 1841) and Inés García García (1795-1865); He was born during the Haitian occupation. His father, born to Italian Bartolomé Costa (b. Verona, Veneto) and Vicenta Toso (Ramírez) Carvajal of Genoese descent, was a clergy involved in politics who represented Santo Domingo from 1827 to 1832 in the legislative Assembly of Haiti as a deputy.\\r\\nMany prominent military and politicians were born into the García family. His maternal grandfather, José Anselmo García, was a sergeant of the Spanish Army who opposed to the ruling of the Lic. José Núñez de Cáceres in Fort San José on the night of November 30, 1821. His uncle, José del Carmen García, was one of the signatories of the Manifesto of January 16, 1844, and then served as lieutenant of artillery in the Battle of Azua, on 19 March 1844. His paternal granduncle, Lic./Capt. Tomás (Toso) Ramírez Carvajal, was a lawyer and mayor of the Royal Audiencia in 1820 and Captain of the Spanish cavalry with a decisive role in the Battle of Palo Hincado. José Gabriel García was also cousin of Pedro Alejandrino Pina Garcia, co-founder of La Trinitaria along with Juan Pablo Duarte as well as cousin, twice removed, of Dr. Juan Vicente Moscoso.\\r\\n\\r\\nMilitary and political career\\r\\nIn 1848, at only 14 years old, José Gabriel García joined the army and was assigned artillery brigade of the Plaza of Santo Domingo, commanded by Colonel Ángel Perdomo (military officer). In 1849, he took part of the maritime expedition of Jean-Charles Fagalde during the Dominican War of Independence. As a soldier, he came to perform various administrative functions and reached the rank of Second Lieutenant (1853). Accused of conspiracy and pursued by the government of Pedro Santana, who had initiated the reintegration of Dominican Republic to Spain, he had to leave the country in 1861, settling in Venezuela for five years.\\r\\nUpon his return from exile, he held public office during the second half of the nineteenth century. Among other functions, he served as:\\r\\n\\r\\nMayor of Santo Domingo (1861)\\r\\nMinister of Justice and Public Instruction (1865, 1876)\\r\\nAdvisor to the Executive Board chaired by José María Cabral  (1865-1866)\\r\\nTriumvirate adviser (1866)\\r\\nPresident of the National Convention (1866,1867)\\r\\nSecretary of External Relations (1866, 1874)\\r\\nDeputy to the National Congress (1874)\\r\\nChairman of the Commission nationalizing the Peninsula and Samana Bay (1874)\\r\\nMinister of the Army and the Navy during Ulises Espaillat presidency (1876)\\r\\nTreasury of Santo Domingo (1898-1908)\\r\\nIn 1866, Jose Gabriel Garcia and Emiliano Tejera created the first Dominican university, the Professional Institute, functioning as a replacement of the previous University Santo Tomás de Aquino (the oldest university in the Americas) which had been closed for more than 45 years and without continuous operation for almost 70 years since the Treaty of Basilea. The Professional Institute was later renamed in 1914 to University of Santo Domingo.\\r\\nIn 1867, José Gabriel García and Emiliano Tejera together with the archbishop Fernando Arturo de Meriño, among others, established the first public library of the Dominican Republic. The donated collections that formed this first public library came from the personal library of the writer Rafael María Baralt\\r\\n\\r\\nLos Amantes de las Letras Society\\r\\nIn 1854, José Gabriel García founded and was the first president of the Amantes de las Letras Society along with poet Manuel Rodríguez Objío and Manuel de Jesús Galván which was the first cultural society in Dominican Republic and created with the purpose of advancing the intellectual progress of the country by providing access to books, newspapers and magazines. The founding of this first cultural society also gives rise to modern Dominican literature.\\r\\nThe society published the newspaper El Oasis in 1854, which was the first cultural newspaper in the country along with the newspaper El Progreso, covering topics such as literature, religion, customs and culture. In 1859 the society published the first Dominican magazine: La Revista Quincenal Dominicana, which had a political-literary character. A year later, Los Amantes de las Letras published the newspaper Flores del Ozama.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1860, the society established the first Dominican theatre with a purely artistic orientation. It was located in the former Church of the Jesuits (today National Pantheon) and presented the works of the most notable Spanish and French authors, as well as of national authors such as Félix María del Monte. The theater was inaugurated on October 13, 1860, with the staging of the drama \"Los dos Virreyes\" by José Zorrilla and the comedy \"Zapatero a tus zapatos\" and playing as actors: Alejandro Román, Luis Betances, Francisco Javier Miura and brothers Manuel de Jesús and José Gabriel García\\r\\nJosé Gabriel García was a member of the Junta Nacional Colombina (1893); corresponding member of the Academia Nacional de la Historia de Venezuela and honorary member of the Academia Nacional de la Historia de la República de Colombia\\r\\nHis writings have been published in newspapers and magazines in Venezuela, Curaçao, Cuba, Spain, the United States and the Dominican Republic.\\r\\nJosé Gabriel García had the opportunity to witness and be a protagonist of some of the events in his works.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrinting and Publishing Company García Hermanos\\r\\nIn 1862, José Gabriel García and his twin brother, Manuel de Jesús García, founded García Hermanos, which included a library, a book store and a publishing and printing company. According to historian Frank Moya Pons, García Hermanos was the first printing and publishing company in the Dominican Republic properly established and it was the leading publishing and editorial company of the 19th and early 20th century in the Dominican Republic. Their book store sold the books of their own catalogue and also imported books. The local also became a hub for the intellectuals of the time.\\r\\nThe first Dominican novel printed in the Dominican Republic was \"La Campana del Higo: Tradición Dominicana\" by Francisco Angulo Guridi and published by García Hermanos in 1866. Other famous publications of the era like \"Lira de Quisqueya\" (1874) collected by José Castellanos, \"Fantasías indígenas\" (1877) by José Joaquín Pérez, \"Adela\" by Francisco Javiar Amiama (1872), \"Los dos restos de Cristóbal Colón\" (1879) by Emiliano Tejera, \"Poesías\" by Salomé Ureña (1880), \"Enriquillo\" by Manuel de Jesús Galván (1882), \"La Hija del Hebreo\" by Federico Henríquez y Carvajal (1883), \"Las vírgenes de Galindo\" by Félix María del Monte[usurped] (1885), \"Poesías\" de Josefa Perdomo Heredia Archived 2017-05-11 at the Wayback Machine (1885), \"Apuntes para la Historia de los Trinitarios\" by José María Serra (1887), \"Moral Social\" by Eugenio María de Hostos (1888) and \"Madre Culpable\" by Amelia Francasci (1893) were also printed and published by the García Hermanos.\\r\\nThe García brothers were also the pioneers in the printing of school textbooks in the Dominican Republic, creating a big impact in the beginnings of the literacy of the country. Books published by them such as \"Elementos de Geografía Física, Política e Histórica de la República Dominicana\" by Fernando Arturo de Meriño and \"Compendio de la Historia de Santo Domingo\" by José Gabriel García were edited and printed in 1866 for the use at Dominican schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1865, García Hermanos elaborated and printed the first Dominican stamps for postage correspondence giving birth to the first Dominican postal system. For decades, they were also the publishers of the Dominican government\\'s Gaceta Oficial. The García brothers were also the mentors and employers of publishers such as José Ricardo Roques, who went on to found La Cuna de América, the second leading publishing company of the time\\r\\nWhen Manuel de Jesús García passed away in 1907, his wife, Josefa Reina, took over the publishing company and it was renamed Imprenta J.R. Vda García, Sucesores. In the early 1900s, J.R. Vda García was the editor and printer of the first Dominican postal cards.  Among its famous publications are \"Décimas\" (1927) by Juan Antonio Alix as well as the first works of Domingo Moreno Jimenes, \"La Promesa\" (1916) and \"Vuelos y Duelos\" (1916). The youngest son of Manuel de Jesús and Josefa, Eduardo García Reina, eventually took charge of the company.\\r\\nIn the 1910s, J.R. Vda García became another pioneer this time in the photography industry in the Dominican Republic by being the first company to provide the photo equipments and services of the Eastman Kodak in the country. Eduardo García Reina, was also the pioneer of the gift shops in the Colonial City when he established the store Recuerdos Dominicanos in the Isabel la Católica street around the same time along with the Kodak business.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath and legacy\\r\\nGarcía died in the city of Santo Domingo on January 19, 1910. His burial tomb is located in the National Pantheon of the Dominican Republic. His cousin and founding member of La Trinitaria, Pedro Alejandrino Pina García, is also buried there. The remains of his father Gabriel Costa lie in the Primate Cathedral of America and his maternal grandmother, Manuela Rita García, is buried in the vault of the Convent of the Dominican Order.\\r\\nThe four sons of José Gabriel García were also prolific writers, historians and politicians. Out of all the children of both José Gabriel García and Manuel de Jesús García, Eduardo García Reina (who married Rosa Perdomo-Frier Guerra), and his half-sister, Natalia Rita García Rodríguez, were the only ones that married and left descendance.\\r\\nThe old street of \"Del Faro\" in the Colonial City of Santo Domingo was named José Gabriel García in his honor.\\r\\nIn Dominican Republic, the National Day of Literacy is commemorated on January 13, in honor of the García brothers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\n\"Compendium of History of Santo Domingo, Vol I\" (1867)\\r\\n\"Brief rebuttal of the report of the Commissioners of Santo Domingo.

He completed postgraduate studies in East Germany at the Weißensee School of Art and Architecture in Berlin and at the Leipzig School of Graphic Art between 1969 and 1971.\\r\\n\\r\\nTeaching work has been present in his artistic career since the 1970s in the Montevideo Engraving Club and several workshops in Uruguay and the United States. He has been a teacher of artists who have managed to develop solid personal careers such as Gladys Afamado, Margaret Whyte, and Marco Maggi. He conducts training workshops on graphic techniques in Montevideo every year, as well as curating exhibitions in Uruguay and abroad, in the quest to revalue engraving as a creative discipline and a platform for contemporary expression for the new generations of artists in his country.\\r\\nHe is a tenured professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz, where he is responsible for the direction of the graphic arts department.\\r\\nIn 1997 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 2001 he represented Uruguay at the Venice Biennale. In 2002 he received the Figari Award in recognition of his career. In 2004 he was awarded the Chancellor\\'s Award and the Prize for Artistic and Scientific Research. He exhibited at the Binghamton University Art Museum (2013) and the Medieval Trinitarian Templespace of the Kiscell Museum, Budapest, Hungary (2010), among other outstanding museums and galleries in various countries.\\r\\nIn 2003 he was invited by the Tate Modern in London to give a conference and present a video about his creations. In 2004 the Samuel Dorsky Art Museum of SUNY New Paltz organized the first retrospective of Cardillo\\'s work. In 2011 the Nassau County Museum of Art in Long Island held the retrospective exhibition \"Jornadas de la memoria\", which included works by the artist over four decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nCardillo has developed a varied series of works that include engravings, sculptures, and installations, where the study of nature and the preservation of his imprint has always been present. His sculptures and installations evoke archaeological sites that revalue the pre-Hispanic imaginary of Uruguayan territory with aesthetic representations - symbols of funerary mounds that allow recreating the collective memory, as well as the artist\\'s metaphorical return to his native land. His fascination with the primitive is also reflected in much of his graphic work, as well as an archeology of natural life in the transfer of forms of animals and plants that resemble fossils made of metal, ceramic, or paper, which reinforce the idea of permanence of culture beyond life and point to the intense trace of the ancestral and the recovery of the past.\\r\\nHis work is held by numerous public and private collections, including the Art Institute of Chicago, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Cincinnati Art Museum, Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes y Literatura of Mexico, Museo de Bellas Artes and Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas, New York Museum of Modern Art, Art Museum of the Americas in Washington, Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College in Ohio, and the National Museum of Visual Arts of Montevideo, the garden of which became home to his 1991 sculpture Barca de la crucifixión in 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial website', 'A journalist is a person who gathers information in the form of text, audio or pictures, processes it into a newsworthy form and disseminates it to the public. This is called journalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nRoles\\r\\nJournalists can be broadcast, print, advertising or public relations personnel. Depending on the form of journalism, \"journalist\" may also describe various categories of people by the roles they play in the process. These includes reporters, correspondents, citizen journalist, editors, editorial writers, columnists and photojournalists.\\r\\nA reporter is a type of journalist who researches, writes and reports on information in order to present using sources. This may entail conducting interviews, information-gathering and/or writing articles. Reporters may split their time between working in a newsroom, from home or outside to witness events or interviewing people. Reporters may be assigned a specific beat (area of coverage).\\r\\n\\r\\nMatthew C. Nisbet, who has written on science communication, has defined a \"knowledge journalist\" as a public intellectual who, like Walter Lippmann, Fareed Zakaria, Naomi Klein, Michael Pollan,  and Andrew Revkin, sees their role as researching complicated issues of fact or science which most laymen would not have the time or access to information to research themselves, then communicating an accurate and understandable version to the public as a teacher and policy advisor.In his best-known books, Public Opinion (1922) and The Phantom Public (1925), Lippmann argued that most people lacked the capacity, time and motivation to follow and analyze news of the many complex policy questions that troubled society. Nor did they often experience most social problems or directly access expert insights. These limitations were made worse by a news media that tended to oversimplify issues and to reinforce stereotypes, partisan viewpoints and prejudices. As a consequence, Lippmann believed that the public needed journalists like himself who could serve as expert analysts, guiding \"citizens to a deeper understanding of what was really important\".\\r\\nIn 2018, the United States Department of Labor\\'s Occupational Outlook Handbook reported that employment for the category \"reporters, correspondents and broadcast news analysts\" will decline 9 percent between 2016 and 2026.\\r\\n\\r\\nModern overview\\r\\nA worldwide sample of 27,500 journalists in 67 countries in 2012–2016 produced the following profile:\\r\\n\\r\\n57 percent male;\\r\\nmean age of 38\\r\\nmean years of experience, 13\\r\\ncollege degree, 56 percent; graduate degree, 29 percent\\r\\n61 percent specialized in journalism/communications at college\\r\\n62 percent identified as generalists and 23 percent as hard-news beat journalists\\r\\n47 percent were members of a professional association\\r\\n80 percent worked full-time\\r\\n50 percent worked in print, 23 percent on television, 17 percent on radio and 16 percent online.\\r\\nIn 2019 the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism  Digital News Report  described the future for journalists in South Africa as “grim” because of low online revenue and plummeting advertising.\\r\\nIn 2020 Reporters Without Borders secretary general Christophe Deloire said journalists in developing countries  were suffering political interference because the COVID-19 pandemic had given governments around the world the chance “to take advantage of the fact that politics are on hold, the public is stunned and protests are out of the question, in order to impose measures that would be impossible in normal times”.\\r\\nIn 2023 the closure of local newspapers in the US accelerated to an average of 2.5 per week, leaving more than 200 US counties as “news deserts” and meaning that more than half of all U.S. counties had limited access to reliable local news and information, according to researchers at the Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications at Northwestern University.\\r\\nIn January 2024,  The Los Angeles Times, Time magazine and National Geographic all conducted layoffs, and Condé Nast journalists went on strike over proposed job cuts. The Los Angeles Times  laid off  more than 20% of the newsroom.\\r\\nCNN, Sports Illustrated and  NBC News shed employees in early 2024. The New York Times reported that Americans were suffering from “news fatigue” due to coverage  of major news stories like the Hamas attack, Russian invasion of Ukraine and the presidential election. American consumers turned away from journalists at legacy organizations as social media became a common news source.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom\\r\\nJournalists sometimes expose themselves to danger, particularly when reporting in areas of armed conflict or in states that do not respect the freedom of the press. Organizations such as the Committee to Protect Journalists and Reporters Without Borders publish reports on press freedom and advocate for journalistic freedom. As of November 2011, the Committee to Protect Journalists reports that 887 journalists have been killed worldwide since 1992 by murder (71%), crossfire or combat (17%), or on dangerous assignment (11%). The \"ten deadliest countries\" for journalists since 1992 have been Iraq (230 deaths), Philippines (109), Russia (77), Colombia (76), Mexico (69), Algeria (61), Pakistan (59), India (49), Somalia (45), Brazil (31) and Sri Lanka (30).\\r\\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists also reports that as of 1 December 2010, 145 journalists were jailed worldwide for journalistic activities. Current numbers are even higher. The ten countries with the largest number of currently-imprisoned journalists are Turkey (95), China (34), Iran (34), Eritrea (17), Burma (13), Uzbekistan (6), Vietnam (5), Cuba (4), Ethiopia (4) and Sudan (3).\\r\\nApart from physical harm, journalists are harmed psychologically. This applies especially to war reporters, but their editorial offices at home often do not know how to deal appropriately with the reporters they expose to danger. Hence, a systematic and sustainable way of psychological support for traumatized journalists is strongly needed. Few and fragmented support programs exist so far.\\r\\nOn 8 August 2023, Iran\\'s Journalists\\' Day, Tehran Journalists\\' Association head Akbar Montajabi noted over 100 journalists arrested amid protests, while HamMihan newspaper exposed repression against 76 media workers since September 2022 following Mahsa Amini\\'s death-triggered mass protests, leading to legal consequences for journalists including Niloufar Hamedi and Elaheh\\r\\n\\r\\nRelationship with sources\\r\\nThe relationship between a professional journalist and a source can be rather complex, and a source can sometimes have an effect on an article written by the journalist. The article \\'A Compromised Fourth Estate\\' uses Herbert Gans\\' metaphor to capture their relationship. He uses a dance metaphor, \"The Tango\", to illustrate the co-operative nature of their interactions inasmuch as \"It takes two to tango\". Herbert suggests that the source often leads, but journalists commonly object to this notion for two reasons:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt signals source supremacy in news making.\\r\\nIt offends journalists\\' professional culture, which emphasizes independence and editorial autonomy.\\r\\nThe dance metaphor goes on to state:\\r\\n\\r\\nA relationship with sources that is too cozy is potentially compromising of journalists\\' integrity and risks becoming collusive. Journalists have typically favored a more robust, conflict model, based on a crucial assumption that if the media are to function as watchdogs of powerful economic and political interests, journalists must establish their independence of sources or risk the fourth estate being driven by the fifth estate of public relations.\\r\\n\\r\\nSafety\\r\\nJournalists can face violence and intimidation for exercising their fundamental right to freedom of expression. The range of threats they are confronted with include murder, kidnapping, hostage-taking, offline and online harassment, intimidation, enforced disappearances, arbitrary detention and torture. Women in journalism also face specific dangers and are especially vulnerable to sexual assault, whether in the form of a targeted sexual violation, often in reprisal for their work. Mob-related sexual violence aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas.\\r\\nIncreasingly, journalists (particularly women) are abused and harassed online, via hate speech, cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking, doxing, trolling, public shaming, intimidation and threats.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost dangerous year\\r\\nAccording to Reporters Without Borders\\' 2018 annual report, it was the worst year on record for deadly violence and abuse toward journalists; there was a 15 percent increase in such killings since 2017, with 80 killed, 348 imprisoned and 60 held hostage.\\r\\nYaser Murtaja was shot by an Israeli army sniper. Rubén Pat was gunned down outside a beach bar in Mexico. Mexico was described by Reporters Without Borders as \"one of world\\'s deadliest countries for the media\"; 90% of attacks on journalists in the country reportedly go unsolved. Bulgarian Victoria Marinova was beaten, raped and strangled. Saudi Arabian dissident Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside Saudi Arabia\\'s consulate in Istanbul.\\r\\n\\r\\nCommemoration\\r\\nFrom 2008 to 2019, Freedom Forum\\'s now-defunct Newseum in Washington, D.C. featured a Journalists Memorial which honored several thousand journalists around the world who had died or were killed while reporting the news. After the Newseum closed in December 2019, supporters of freedom of the press persuaded the United States Congress in December 2020 to authorize the construction of a memorial to fallen journalists on public land with private funds.  By May 2023, the Fallen Journalists Memorial Foundation had begun the design of the memorial.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\nIn the US, nearly all journalists have attended university, but only about half majored in journalism.  Journalists who work in television or for newspapers are more likely to have studied journalism in college than journalists working for the wire services, in radio, or for news magazines.\\r\\n\\r\\nGallery\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nBibliography\\r\\nDeuze, Mark. \"What is journalism?

Artistically, Rodez is known for his textured luminescent paintings and his Minimalist-Dadaist sculptures. Among his most displayed works are Custom-made Paradise, his round portrait of Spanish Surrealist Salvador Dal� from Rodez�s XX Century Masters series, and the sensual kinetic giant inflatable sculpture Lucky Link from his Imagine Liberation series. He has written several published articles on art, law, and community issues and has been an Editor in Chief for law magazines and publications.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nMiguel Rodez was born in 1956 in the Casablanca area of Havana, Cuba as the first of four children, with one brother and two sisters. From the age of four, Rodez showed an early inclination toward the arts and was supported by his parents as he regularly spent hours drawing and painting. On the eve of Thanksgiving Day 1969 Rodez and his family relocated to New York City under the Freedom Flights refugee program. In New York City, Rodez sought to attend an art school and pursue a career as a visual artist and architect. He was subsequently accepted and briefly attended the High School of Art and Design in close proximity to the Museum of Modern Art. However, family circumstances kept him from remaining enrolled and, as a result, Rodez is an autodidactic artist.\\r\\nIn 1972, his family moved briefly to Union City, New Jersey and then in 1973 to Miami, Florida. In Miami, Rodez graduated from Miami Beach Senior High School in 1975 and weighed whether to pursue art or a legal career. He ultimately settled on a legal career, as this would not prevent him from creating art. He subsequently pursued several degrees in higher education, first enrolling at Miami-Dade Community College, where he obtained an Associate of Arts Degree in Business Administration, summa cum laude in 1979. He then attended the University of Miami where he majored in History, with minors in English and Philosophy and graduated with honors in 1981. While at the University of Miami, Rodez also took Art History Courses and a figure drawing class. Rodez went on to obtain a Doctor of Jurisprudence at Indiana University in 1985.  \\r\\nRodez subsequently became an attorney in 1986 and opened his law practice devoted to representing mostly underprivileged clients. Rodez also engaged in various forms of public service, often related to the arts, such as serving on multiple community boards.\\r\\nIn November 1994, Miguel Rodez obtained a quasi-judicial position in the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (later known as the Citizenship and Immigration Services). In 1996, he ran for Circuit Court Judge, an election he narrowly lost. Therefore, he continued his career with the Federal Government. In 1997, Rodez founded CABA Briefs magazine for the Cuban American Bar Association. In 2007, he began producing artwork professionally and by 2010, he had two careers simultaneously. During this period, Rodez worked at his CIS post, participated in a multitude of art exhibitions, and also curated over two dozen art shows. In 2018, he retired early from his position with the CIS to pursue his art career full time. Since then, Rodez has developed an extensive art record that has been covered by media and analyzed by art critics.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt career overview\\r\\nRodez showed artistic inclinations from an early age. After leaving Cuba for the United States with his family in 1969, Rodez briefly attended New York City�s High School of Art and Design. However, his attendance at that school was cut short, as his family had moved to Union City, New Jersey and later to Miami. Consequently, Rodez never received specialized art training with the exception of a figure drawing course at the University of Miami while majoring in History. \\r\\nFollowing his graduation from Miami Beach Senior High School in 1975, Rodez returned to New York City for two years yet struggled to support himself as an artist, leading him to instead to pursue his other interest of becoming an attorney in South Florida. During his legal career Rodez continued painting and supporting the arts. While working as a lawyer and later in as civil servant, Rodez supported non-profit cultural and legal organizations. He served as the Chairperson of the Miami Symphony Orchestra while it was directed by Manuel Ochoa. In 1994, Miguel Rodez and Alberto Bustamante co-founded Herencia Magazine for the Cuban Heritage Foundation. He also served as the editor, designer, and illustrator for CABA Briefs magazine for the Cuban American Bar Association. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1994 to 2000, Rodez served on the Board of Trustees for Art in Public Places at Miami Dade County, where he was elected the Board�s Chairperson in 1997. During his tenure at Art in Public Places, Rodez participated in selecting artists to be commissioned to create major public art projects for Miami Dade County. Most notable among the projects are: Jose Bedia, Cundo Bermudez, Gary Moore, Anna Valentina Murch, and Robert Rahway Zakanitch for The Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts; Carlos Alves, Connie Lloveras, Buster Simpson for the Miami-Dade Metrorail and Metromover Stations; Miami International Airport�s A Walk of the Beach by Michelle Oka Donner; and Airport Sound Wall by Martha Schwartz, among others.\\r\\nIn 2007, Rodez decided to pursue two careers as an artist in addition to his civil service post. He entered the professional arts field with pieces featuring elements of Dadaism and Minimalism. His first professional creation from this period was Time Machine (2007), a large wheeled conceptual sculpture that explores time travel. He later temporarily merged the piece with another to form an installation titled Knowledge Quest (2007). \\r\\nIn 2010 Rodez rented a space in the studio of Yovani Bauta and began to produce artwork and to exhibit extensively. Then, in 2012, he opened his own gallery and studio space in Miami�s Bird Road Art District, where he curated solo and collective shows and often contributed his own works. That same year Rodez also held a charity exhibition of his Imagine Liberation series in the Miami Design District to support the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America non-profit. Rodez�s work can be found in the permanent collection of several fine art institutions and private collections including the Favalora Museum at St. Thomas University, Florida International University�s Green Library Special Collections and Honors College Collection, and the Flores Carbonel Collection. The University of Miami Cuban Heritage Collection also holds records relating to Rodez�s career in its archives due to its significance to the Cuban community.\\r\\n\\r\\nCuratorship\\r\\nMiguel Rodez�s work in public art selection eventually led him to become a curator who has received reviews from critics. This public art involvement began with the Metropolitan Miami Dade County Art in Public Places Trust, a quasi-governmental entity that is responsible for the commission and purchase of artworks by contemporary artists in all media at Miami Dade. As a Trust Board Member, Rodez helped oversee the program�s operation. This included voting on whether or not to approve public art acquisitions, commissions, project funding, and on restoration and maintenance of existing public art. The budget for projects ranged from below $100,000 to several million dollars. Rodez joined the Art in Public Places Trust as a Board Member in 1994, became its Chairperson in 1997, and served the program until 2000.\\r\\nRodez has since participated in selecting artwork for inclusion in various exhibits and as a juror for the purpose of conferring art awards. This included his service as a juror for the largest street art festival in the United States, The Coconut Grove Arts Festival (selection date October 17, 2018); Nineteenth Annual Cuba Nostalgia Art Competition (May 19, 2017); Carnival on the Mile, art fair (March 4, 2017); Ludlam Lights, Annual Art Lantern Competition (February 25, 2017); Art of Found Objects Exhibit (March 29, 2016); Broward Art Guild�s �Food for Thought exhibit� (March 6, 2015); and Carlos Albizu University�s Art Fest @ Doral (November 7, 2014 and November 15, 2013).\\r\\nRodez has curated over 35 art exhibits, including exhibitions and presentations held at museums, cultural venues and a gallery space he managed at the Bird Road Art District from 2012 to 2018. Among the most notable exhibits that Rodez organized and presented were the ones held at academic venues. Miguel Rodez curated two exhibits - �Dealing with Reality� (August 1, 2019) and �Open Discourse� � at the Favalora Museum at St. Thomas University. He curated two exhibits � �Eight Visual Paths� (April 20, 2019) and �Reference Cited� (September 8, 2018) � at Florida International University�s Steven & Dorothea Green Library. He curated �What�s on Your Palette,� (November 30, 2017) a 140-artists exhibit held at the Milander Center for the Arts. He also curated two exhibits � Art Fest @ Doral 2013 and 2014 � at Carlos Albizu University.\\r\\nDuring the six years that he operated Miguel Rodez Art Projects, his art space became a popular venue. There Rodez hosted several exhibits and gained the notice of Frommers Travel Guide for Miami that encouraged Miami travelers to visit his space in its 2014 edition. One show that Rodez organized to honor Spanish Surrealist Salvador Dal� drew the attention of The Dal� Museum, which commented on the exhibit. Some of the shows also drew reviews and coverage from ArtDistricts Magazine, Nagari Magazine, Miami Art Guide, and leading Spanish-language newspaper El Nuevo Herald.\\r\\nIn November 2019, Latin American Art Magazine published a bilingual article authored by Miguel Rodez regarding the role of a curator. He also co-authored an article on ArtDistricts Magazine on the emerging Bird Road Art District. Based on his curatorial experience, Rodez has been asked to comment on articles by El Nuevo Herald, such as reviews of Cuban artist Sergio Ch�vez\\' Beyond Innocence exhibition and \\r\\na cultural festival honoring renown Cuban Master Amelia Pel�ez.\\r\\n\\r\\nLegal career\\r\\nIn 1981 Miguel Rodez enrolled the Maurer School of Law, one of the oldest law schools in the United States and located at Indiana University�s Bloomington campus. There, Rodez obtained his Doctor of Jurisprudence 1985. In 1986, he received his license to practice law in Florida after passing the Florida Bar Exam. Soon after, Rodez opened a private practice in Miami and later Coral Gables, Florida. During the years that he worked as an attorney, Rodez represented mostly elderly and underprivileged clients regarding a wide variety of legal matters. \\r\\nEarly in his legal career, Rodez became involved with the Cuban American Bar Association (CABA). Rodez was later elected to its Board of Directors by a majority of its over 700 members. In 1994, Rodez served as chair of the multi-ethnic outreach committee of the Transit 2020 Coalition advocating for the Miami Metro transit system. That year he closed his legal practice and accepted a quasi-judicial position with the United States federal government, where he worked at his new civil servant position within the Citizenship and Immigration Services (formerly known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service). While working for the CIS, Rodez conducted research, engaged in analysis and wrote assessments regarding human rights issues in cases where parties appeared before him, with or without an attorney. In this role, Rodez accepted numerous overseas assignments to do similar work in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. During his tenure Rodez received various service awards, including a national employee award from United States Attorney General Janet Reno on April 28, 1995. Rodez also headed the performance-evaluation team that mentored new asylum officers and presided over more than 700 hearings.\\r\\nIn 1996, while still working for the Federal government, Miguel Rodez ran for Circuit Court Judge in Miami-Dade County, Florida. In that contest, The Miami Herald�s Editorial Board supported both candidates stating �No matter which candidate they elect, in our judgement voters can hardly go wrong in this contest� and �whoever loses this race [�] it won�t be the voters.� While Rodez reportedly meet with over 15,000 voters during his campaign, he ultimately lost that election to Leon Firtel. Following his electoral loss, Rodez continued to work at his Civil Service post with the CIS.\\r\\nDuring his legal career Rodez was also a member of the Florida Bar\\'s Long Range Planning Committee and in the mid-1990s served as a co-editor for The Dade County Bar Association�s newspaper, the DCBA Bulletin. There, Rodez helped in editing articles on various legal issues written by other attorneys and legal scholars. He also authored judicial profiles highlighting various judges, including Circuit Court Judge Stan Blake. In 1997, while serving on CABA�s board of directors, Rodez founded the organization�s news magazine CABA Briefs. Rodez was subsequently one of the main figures during the magazine�s founding years when he served as its editor, main contributor, layout designer and illustrator. After two years he resigned to work on other community service projects and his ongoing role in the CIS. In his capacities as an advocate, former political candidate, editor, and leading member of several public boards, Rodez has penned several published opinion-editorials for the Miami Herald and was also covered by El Nuevo Herald. After 23 years, Rodez retired from his civil service position in 2018 and returned his focus exclusively to art.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt analysis\\r\\nMiguel Rodez is a multidisciplinary autodidactic visual artist. Over the course of his career, his artwork has been covered by The Miami Herald, El Nuevo Herald, international tourist guide Frommers, The Miami Laker, Art Districts Magazine, ArtFix Daily, Art Talk, and several art critics. Rodez works in various media including drawing, monotype, painting, installation, sculpture, and fine arts photography. The most notable feature consistent through much of Miguel Rodez�s work is his use of texture, which is central to his defined artistic style. The surfaces of his canvases, which are often round (called �tondos�), show textured brushstrokes overlaid with pigment-rich iridescent paint.\\r\\n\\r\\nRodez frequently works in series. His Twentieth Century Masters series is a collection of monumental round portraits depicting famous visual artists of the period. This includes portraits of Jean-Michel Basquiat, Marc Chagall, Salvador Dal�, Frida Kahlo, Pablo Picasso, Andy Warhol, and famed fellow Cuban artist Wifredo Lam. Aldo Menendez, a Cuban artist and critic regarded as a leading voice in Cuban art in the United States, reviewed Miguel Rodez�s portrait series exhibited at St. Thomas University�s Sardi�as Gallery. According to Menendez, �[Miguel Rodez] is an artist in full maturity and mastery of his trade, with several exhibitions and stages behind him and a particular stamp on everything.� Among other things, Menendez noticed the irony in Miguel Rodez choice of painting a portrait of Andy Warhol, an artist who disassembled portraits, as he considered them to be merely impersonal objects such as reproductions in a newspaper or a ticket, while Miguel Rodez demonstrates a desire to recreate the portrait again as a healthy, careful interrogation executed with a holistic philosophy.\\r\\nThe Imagine Liberation series explores an imaginary quest for freedom. This series utilizes imagery that envisions the perspective of someone trapped in an unfavorable circumstance and dreams of the moment when the chains that bind one rupture and freedom is gained. Art critic Carlos Suarez de Jesus opined that �The reductive, serial quality of this series is deceptively simple while intrinsically profound. These works succeed in evoking the sublime through monochromatic forms, effortless beauty, tactile surfaces, and range of scale.� Suarez de Jesus noted: �Nelson Mandela�s harsh years in prison taught him something about the indomitable will of the spirit. He said of his experience: �For to be free is not merely to cast off one�s chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.� Suarez de Jesus added, �Instead of conveying a sense of instability and restlessness in his work, through the process of much thought, Rodez captures the spirit of Mandela�s sentiment.�\\r\\nThe Escape series, like his Imagine Liberation series seeks to generate a discourse about departure from one�s physical or metaphysical location to one of hope. These paintings seek to provide the viewer with visual relief (hence the term �escape�) through the use of calming colors such as cool teals, aqua and blues. \\r\\nThe Floral Sensuality series uses flowers to address human sexuality and gender identification issues in unexpected ways. Intended as a masculine response to Georgia O\\'Keeffe�s flower series, Rodez likewise infuses sensual qualities to botanical imagery.\\r\\nHis Sweet Vibrations series utilizes harmonic color combinations in conjunction with loose rhythmic patterns. The title of the pieces alludes to musical compositions only for the purpose of identification. Through this seemingly innocuous collection of works, Rodez is challenging the perceptions of the definition of art in a similar way to the Pattern and Decoration art movement of the mid-1970s to mid-1980s.\\r\\nThe Monumental series is Rodez�s exploration of three dimensional form. This collection of sculptures possesses elements of symbolic Minimalism as well as Dadaism. The series� most notable piece is the colossal 20 foot (approximately six meters) high Lucky Link where Rodez merges the concept of his Imagine Liberation series with his Floral Sensuality series to come up with a kinetic sculpture that uses a link breaking to symbolize freedom as a chain breaks. The piece has been shown multiple times with Alejandro Mendoza�s collective group exhibitions Giants in the City alongside other established Miami artists such as Yovani Bauta, Jose Bedia, Tomas Esson, Miguel Fleitas, and Frank Hyder.\\r\\nRodez�s Forever Dal� is a surrealist installation consisting of four large-scale images of his portrait of Salvador Dal� strategically placed in a deep hallway. The installation conceptually provides Dal� with the eternity that Dal� sought, which was spotlighted by The Dal� Museum on its social media in 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nGallery\\r\\nSelected exhibitions\\r\\nThough he had been creating art for over 30 years by the time he formally launched his professional fine art career in 2007, Miguel Rodez had not exhibited his work until after that point. Since then, Rodez has participated in over 80 exhibitions of his art in fine art galleries, art centers, international art fairs, and public spaces. He has also exhibited alongside established artists such as Laurence Gartel, Rafael Soriano, and Nestor Arenas. His work has been featured in several museums including the Coral Gables Museum, Coral Springs Museum, the Frost Museum Sculpture Garden, the Jewish Museum of Florida, and the Dominican Republic Palace of Fine Arts.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected solo exhibitions\\r\\n10/03/2019\\t�Arte Orgullo, Master Portraits,� Pridelines Gallery, Miami Florida.\\r\\n07/05/2019\\t�Emerging Harmonies� Miami Lakes Town Hall, Miami Lakes, Florida.\\r\\n03/09/2019\\t�Painting Provocateurs,� St. Thomas University�s Sardi�as Gallery, Miami, Florida.\\r\\n07/21/2017\\t�20th Century Masters� Coral Gables Museum, Coral Gables, Florida.\\r\\n07/28/2016\\t�An Evening with Miguel Rodez,� Steven & Dorothea Green Library, Florida International University, Miami Florida.\\r\\n05/16/2015\\t�Visual Poetry Project,� Bird Road Art District, Miami, Florida.\\r\\n03/21/2015\\t�Spring forward,� Bird Road Art District, Miami Florida.\\r\\n09/20/2014\\t�Power Portraits,� Bird Road Art District, Miami Florida.\\r\\n05/17/2014  �Unveiling Joaquin,� Bird Road Art District, Miami Florida.\\r\\n03/15/2014\\t�Imagine Liberation� Bird Road Art District, Miami Florida.\\r\\n12/15/2012\\t�Primal Connection,� Bird Road Art District, Miami Florida.\\r\\n11/17/2012\\t�Imagine Liberation,� Bird Road Art District, Miami.\\r\\n02/11/2012\\t�Imagine Liberation,� Majestic Properties, Miami Design District, Miami Florida.\\r\\n05/06/2011\\t�Imagine Liberation,� Domingo Padron Gallery, Coral Gables Florida.\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected collective exhibitions\\r\\n08/21/2020\\t�Expressions of a Pandemic,� Coral Gables Museum, Coral Gables, Florida.\\r\\n02/15/2020\\t�Jane Harris Memorial Exhibit,� Harris Art Gallery, Miami Florida.\\r\\n11/09/2019\\t�Passage to Memory� Caballero Rivero Woodlawn, Miami Florida.\\r\\n10/25/2019\\t�Searching for Giants,�  Ft.

Doctor Who and two of its spin-offs. Sarah Jane is a dogged investigative journalist who first encounters alien time traveller the Doctor while trying to break a story on a top secret research facility, and subsequently becomes his travelling companion on a series of adventures spanning the breadth of space and time. After travelling with The Doctor in four seasons of the show they suddenly part ways, and after this she continues to investigate strange goings-on back on Earth. Over time, Sarah Jane establishes herself as a committed defender of Earth from alien invasions and other threats, occasionally reuniting with The Doctor in the course of her own adventures, all the while continuing to work as a freelance investigative journalist.\\r\\nSarah Jane is one of the Doctor\\'s longest-serving companions, co-starring in 18 stories (80 episodes) with the third and fourth incarnations of the Doctor, on the programme from 1973 to 1976 (seasons 11 – 14). She and robotic dog K9 appear in the 1981 television pilot K-9 and Company. She returned in the 20th-anniversary Fifth Doctor story The Five Doctors (1983) and the 30th-anniversary story Dimensions in Time (1993), then co-starred in two BBC radio serials with the Third Doctor (The Paradise of Death and The Ghosts of N-Space), and starred in a series of spin-off audio dramas entitled Sarah Jane Smith for independent production company Big Finish. After the television revival of Doctor Who in 2005, she appears in several episodes with the Tenth Doctor, and as the central character of her own series The Sarah Jane Adventures from 2007 to 2011, which included appearances by both the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors.\\r\\nIn April 2020, former Doctor Who showrunner Russell T Davies released an epilogue to Sarah Jane\\'s story on the anniversary of Sladen\\'s death, detailing various characters attending Sarah\\'s funeral.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasting\\r\\nDoctor Who producer Barry Letts offered the part of Sarah Jane to actress April Walker, who accepted the role and was duly contracted by the BBC. During rehearsals for The Time Warrior, it became clear to Jon Pertwee and Letts that the two leads had little rapport and were physically mis-matched (it has been claimed that Pertwee demanded the part be recast, because Walker was too tall for the role). Letts therefore released Walker from her contract (though she was still paid in full for season 11). Although committed to not talking about the issue in her release agreement, Walker began to discuss the circumstances surrounding her casting decades later. After giving some written interviews to fanzines, in May 2020 Walker gave an on screen interview to \\'Time Space Visualiser\\' giving much further detail about the circumstances, including revealing later work alongside Pertwee. Walker admitted that although she understood Pertwee\\'s thinking, she told him she would never forgive him for what he had done. Letts began a second batch of auditions and saw Elisabeth Sladen after a recommendation from fellow BBC producer Bill Slater, who had twice cast the actress recently in separate episodes of Z-Cars. Sladen performed her audition alongside actor Stephen Thorne and after impressing Letts, he arranged for her to meet Pertwee before any decisions were made. Pertwee stood behind Sladen and gave a \\'thumbs-up\\' to Letts who then offered her the role.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppearances\\r\\nTelevision\\r\\n1973–1976, 1981, 1983; introduction and classic run\\r\\nSarah Jane first appears in the Third Doctor serial The Time Warrior (1973–74), where she has managed to infiltrate a top secret research facility by posing as her aunt, Lavinia Smith, a famous virologist. Introduced as an ardent feminist, Sarah Jane sneaks aboard the TARDIS and becomes embroiled in a battle against a militaristic alien Sontaran in the Middle Ages who is kidnapping scientists from the present day. Subsequently, she accompanies The Doctor (Jon Pertwee) on several journeys in the TARDIS, and she also assists the United Nations Intelligence Taskforce led by Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) on a number of occasions. After Pertwee\\'s departure, Sladen remains following Season 11 finale Planet of the Spiders (1974), in which The Doctor regenerates for the third time.  In season 12\\'s consecutive 1975 serials The Sontaran Experiment, Genesis of the Daleks and Revenge of the Cybermen, Sarah and male companion Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter) face the series\\' three iconic recurring creatures, the Sontarans, the Daleks and the Cybermen. In Genesis Sarah is present at the creation of the Daleks and meets their creator, Davros (Michael Wisher). Sarah Jane departs in the Season 14 serial The Hand of Fear (1976) after The Doctor receives a summons to his home planet, Gallifrey. Sladen has described Sarah as \"a bit of a cardboard cut-out. Each week it used to be, \\'Yes Doctor, no Doctor\\'...\"\\r\\nFollowing her tenure as a companion, Sladen reprised the role of Sarah Jane in a pilot episode for an Earth-based spin-off series, K-9 and Company, in 1981. In the pilot episode, titled \"A Girl\\'s Best Friend\", Sarah Jane receives the robot dog K9 Mark III (John Leeson) as a Christmas present from The Doctor. The pilot did not lead to a series, but the character reappeared in Doctor Who for the 1983 twentieth anniversary story The Five Doctors, in which she is transported to Gallifrey by Lord President Borusa (Philip Latham) to take part in the Game of Rassilon in The Death Zone devised by Time Lord founder Rassilon (Richard Mathews). Here, Sarah is reunited with the Third Doctor, and also meets the First, Second and Fifth. The Five Doctors shows that Sarah Jane still owns and is working with K9. The character made an appearance in the 1993 Children in Need special (a crossover with long-running British soap EastEnders), Dimensions in Time, wherein various Doctors and companions are teleported to Albert Square as part of a plot by the Rani (Kate O\\'Mara). Though Sladen would not make any more official Doctor Who television appearances until 2006, in the interval the actress reprised her role as Sarah Jane twice on BBC radio with Jon Pertwee, and in a series of Big Finish audio dramas, and in the unofficial direct-to-video spin-off film Downtime (1995) alongside the Brigadier, Second Doctor companion Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling) and Leeson in a rare on-screen role.\\r\\n\\r\\n2006–2011, 2020, 2023; revived series and spin-off\\r\\nFollowing Russell T Davies\\' 2005 Doctor Who revival, Sladen returned to the show in the Series 2 episode \"School Reunion\" (2006). \"School Reunion\" revisits Sarah Jane, still working alongside K9 since The Five Doctors, when she encounters the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant) while they both investigate mysterious goings on at a school run by Headmaster Finch (Anthony Head). Exposition in the episode reveals that, having waited years for The Doctor to return to her, Sarah Jane assumed he had died, though later came to suspect his involvement when witnessing the alien spaceship above London in Doctor Who Christmas special \"The Christmas Invasion\". On meeting Sarah Jane, current companion Rose (Billie Piper) reflects on her future after The Doctor. Though K9 Mark III still assists Sarah Jane, he has fallen into disrepair; after K9 Mark III sacrifices himself to save Sarah Jane and The Doctor, The Doctor leaves Sarah Jane a new K9 model, K9 Mark IV, and takes her advice by inviting Rose\\'s boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) aboard the TARDIS as his second companion. The success of \"School Reunion\" led to the development of The Sarah Jane Adventures, starring Sladen as Sarah Jane, produced by BBC Wales for CBBC.\\r\\nIn The Sarah Jane Adventures, Sarah Jane investigates alien activity covertly from her manor house in Bannerman Road in Ealing, driving an emerald green Nissan Figaro and with the help of her sentient supercomputer Mr Smith (voice of comedian Alexander Armstrong), as well as an alien activity scanner and sonic lipstick device. In the special premiere episode \"Invasion of the Bane\" (2007), Sarah Jane adopts a son: Bane creation, genetic archetype and boy genius Luke Smith (Tommy Knight), and befriends her neighbour Maria Jackson (Yasmin Paige) during her investigation of Bane leader Mrs Wormwood (Samantha Bond). Sarah Jane remarks that since meeting them she is no longer content to live alone; she discloses she never married after parting from the Fourth Doctor, to whom no one could ever compare. Sometime between \"School Reunion\" and \"Invasion of the Bane\", K9 has left Sarah Jane to close off a black hole, occasionally passing close enough to contact her; due to the concurrent development of the K-9 television series, to which creator Bob Baker owns the rights, K9 only appears in two episodes of the first series. In the first series, Sarah Jane learns how to be a mother to Luke, the while strengthening her friendship with teenage neighbour Maria, the person Sarah Jane \"trusts the most\". Along with Luke and his friend Clyde Langer (Daniel Anthony) they defeat and repel various threats to the contemporary Earth. Amongst these threats, series one introduces The Trickster (Paul Marc Davis), a cosmic being who makes alterations to the timeline to cause chaos and destruction; he becomes a recurring adversary for Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane finds a new enemy in the Slitheen, a family of criminal aliens originally seen in Doctor Who, and an ally in alien research scientist Professor Rivers (Floella Benjamin). Time travel scenes also depict 13-year-old Sarah Jane (Jessica Ashworth), for whom the death of her best friend Andrea Yates (Jane Asher) gave Sarah Jane her resolve to fight against loss of life.\\r\\nSarah Jane then reappears in Doctor Who in the two-part fourth series finale episodes \"The Stolen Earth\" and \"Journey\\'s End\" (2008), which crosses over from Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures. When Daleks invade Earth, Sarah Jane is summoned along with UNIT officer Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman) and Torchwood leader Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) by former PM Harriet Jones (Penelope Wilton) to help The Doctor save the universe. On the Dalek ship Davros (Julian Bleach) recognises Sarah Jane from their encounter in the classic series\\' episode Genesis of the Daleks. In The Sarah Jane Adventures second series (2008), Maria moves away to America in The Last Sontaran, and Sarah Jane befriends new neighbour Rani Chandra (Anjli Mohindra) in The Day of the Clown; the same episode features flashbacks to Sarah Jane\\'s (Jessica Mogridge) childhood in her Aunt Lavinia\\'s home. In The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith, Sarah Jane saves the lives of her parents, Eddie (Christopher Pizzey) and Barbara (Rosanna Lavelle) in 1951; by doing so she plays into The Trickster\\'s hands, creating a post-apocalyptic alternative universe in the present day. Learning of this however, her parents choose to die, becoming heroes to restore the timeline. In series two finale Enemy of the Bane, Sarah Jane\\'s old friend Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney) from UNIT assists her against united adversaries Mrs Wormwood and Sontaran Commander Kaagh (Anthony O\\'Donnell). Sarah Jane feels threatened on a personal level by Mrs Wormwood\\'s claim to be Luke\\'s mother as his creator. Sladen has relatively scarce screen-time in \\'Sarah-lite\\' serial The Mark of the Berserker due to back-to-back filming. Though K9 makes no appearances in series two, he appears to assist Sarah Jane against Ambassador Ranius (Ronnie Corbett) in a mini-episode for Comic Relief (2009).\\r\\nIn series three (2009), Sarah Jane makes a new enemy in the body-stealing alien Androvax (Mark Goldthorp) as well as a lukewarm ally in the form of the interplanetary police force, the Judoon (from Doctor Who). In the second two-parter, Sarah Jane is able to recover K9 full-time (reflecting a real-world deal struck with the creators of the children\\'s series K-9). In a crossover with the parent show, Sarah Jane reveals her intention to marry her secret fiancé, barrister Peter Dalton, in The Wedding of Sarah Jane Smith. However, Dalton\\'s involvement in Sarah Jane\\'s life proves to be a scheme of The Trickster. The Doctor gatecrashes the wedding to foil The Trickster\\'s plot to make Sarah Jane give up on alien hunting, and explains to Sarah Jane that The Trickster is a powerful member of the extra-dimensional so-called Pantheon of Discord. The serial clarifies that Sarah Jane owes her independent wealth to her Aunt Lavina\\'s will. In \\'Sarah-lite\\' two-parter Mona Lisa\\'s Revenge, Sarah Jane and Luke have their first argument as he progresses into his teenage years; they argue about the cleanliness of Luke\\'s room. In series finale The Gift, though she is reluctant to use weapons or cause harm, when Luke falls deathly ill for the first time ever due to the machinations of the Blathereen-Slitheen, Sarah Jane takes up arms to confront them. In the episode\\'s conclusion, regretfully she is forced to kill them using Mr Smith.\\r\\nSarah Jane next appears in the Tenth Doctor two-part Doctor Who finale, \"The End of Time\", in 2010. When The Doctor is slowly dying from radiation poisoning, he makes timely visits to his close friends and companions; The Doctor saves Luke\\'s life from an oncoming car on Bannerman Road (an inside joke by Russell T Davies commenting on actors\\' failure to look for cars before crossing the street because traffic is always stopped for them, something that he believes is especially important in a children’s show) and bids a silent farewell to Luke and to Sarah Jane.\\r\\nIn the fourth season (2010) of The Sarah Jane Adventures, Sarah Jane sees Luke off to university in the first two-parter of the series, but continues her adventures alongside Rani and Clyde. The trio encounter the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith), as well as Sarah Jane\\'s immediate predecessor as The Doctor\\'s companion, Jo Grant (Katy Manning), in Death of the Doctor; aliens known as the Shansheeth fake The Doctor\\'s death as part of a plot to gain access to the TARDIS using Jo and Sarah Jane\\'s memories. The Empty Planet is this series\\' \\'Sarah-lite\\' serial; with the rest of the population, Sarah Jane mysteriously vanishes, leaving Rani and Clyde to investigate without her. In Lost in Time, Sarah Jane is sent back in time on a mission from the mysterious Shopkeeper (Cyril Nri). Sarah Jane is convinced to retire by an alien plot in the series finale, earning a new nemesis and doppelgänger in Ruby White (Julie Graham); she is saved from Ruby when Luke drives down from university to her rescue.\\r\\nSladen\\'s death ended the show in the middle of its fifth series, which aired in 2011. In its premiere story, Sarah Jane adopts a new child in the form of Sky Smith (Sinead Michael), a genetically-engineered alien girl with abilities relating to electromagnetism; the Shopkeeper arranged for their encounter, but declines to explain his motives to Sarah Jane. Sarah Jane\\'s final broadcast appearance comes in series five finale The Man Who Never Was. The final story ends with a short montage of archive footage and audio recordings celebrating Sarah Jane\\'s journey from lone investigator to mother of two surrounded by friends. The series ends with the final caption: \"And the story goes on... forever.\"\\r\\nThe cast and writers of The Sarah Jane Adventures produced a special 2020 webcast epilogue for the show with a mix of narrated and acted elements entitled \"Farewell, Sarah Jane\". In the story, Sarah Jane\\'s friends and many past companions of the Doctor return to London to attend her funeral.\\r\\nIn the 60th Anniversary special, “The Giggle”, it is confirmed that the character of Sarah Jane Smith has passed away. In the episode, the newly bi-generated Fifteenth Doctor reminisces with the Fourteenth Doctor about all the loss that they have suffered up to that point in their lives. Amongst the names and events mentioned, the Fifteenth Doctor mentions that Sarah Jane is gone and both Doctors express their love for her.\\r\\n\\r\\nLiterature\\r\\nSarah Jane appears in several Doctor Who novels and short stories, notably in the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels Interference: Book One and Interference: Book Two by Lawrence Miles; and the Past Doctor Adventures novel Bullet Time by David A. McIntee, all taking place after she stops travelling with The Doctor. She appears in Ian Marter\\'s Harry Sullivan\\'s War published by Target Books; Marter played companion Harry Sullivan in seven television serials. Different accounts of Sarah Jane\\'s life have been given in the Doctor Who literature. Interference and the Virgin New Adventures novel Christmas on a Rational Planet, also by Miles, suggest that Sarah Jane married someone named Paul Morley sometime between 1996 and 1998 and took his name. In the short story \"Lily\" by Jackie Marshall, in Big Finish\\'s Short Trips: A Christmas Treasury, the Fifth Doctor pays a visit to an older Sarah Jane, who has a daughter, Lauren, and an autistic granddaughter, Lily; Lauren\\'s father is named Will. In the Past Doctor Adventure Bullet Time, Sarah Jane is apparently killed—although the story is ambiguous about whether she actually dies—in 1997 when she sacrifices herself so that she cannot be used as a hostage to stop the Seventh Doctor from taking action to aid an escaping alien ship, contradicting her other spin-off appearances. However, the novel takes place during a story arc where enemies of The Doctor were attempting to eliminate his companions from the Timeline (revealed in the later novel Sometime Never...), and Sarah Jane\\'s death may have been reversed when those enemies are defeated. In any case, other stories have shown her alive after 1997. Sarah Jane was mentioned in the prologue of the Virgin Publishing novelisation of The Power of the Daleks by John Peel. It revealed that Sarah Jane was working as UNIT\\'s official chronicler and that in \"1996\" she covered the aftermath of the Cybermen\\'s failed attempt to drain Earth of its energy and the technology left behind in their wake (The Tenth Planet, which was actually set in 1986).\\r\\nStories written as in-universe articles in Doctor Who Magazine Winter Special 1991 (subtitled \"UNIT Exposed\"), made statements about Sarah Jane\\'s life after leaving the Fourth Doctor. She wrote a history of UNIT, Fighting for Humankind (\"heavily vetted and evidently subjected to considerable censorship\"), as well as a series of science fiction novels. These featured an extraterrestrial called The Doctor and his companion Nicola Jones, who frequently encountered WIN (World Investigative Network), commanded by General Lutwidge-Douglas. Titles included Day of the Dinosaurs, Sutekh the Destroyer and The North Sea Monster.\\r\\nAnother in-universe article was written by Kevin W. Parker, Roving Reporter, which was a biography of Sarah Jane from her childhood to the early 1990s. She grew up with her aunt Lavinia after her parents died in a car crash. She went to Caterham School For Girls and the University of Nottingham. She was engaged to Andrew Lofts, an aspiring television journalist; it didn\\'t last. She ended up working with UNIT; her exact duties were never described. In the spring of 1981, she left UNIT after being hospitalized from an accident in a quarry.  Afterwards she developed a romantic relationship with Harry Sullivan; they parted amicably and were still very fond of each other, and were still close friends, even to the time of the article. She wrote science fiction novels World War Skaro and The Monster at the End of Space which made it onto the Times and New York Times bestseller lists.\\r\\nThough there are as yet no original Sarah Jane Adventures novels, many of the television episodes have been novelised.\\r\\n\\r\\nAudio drama\\r\\nBetween seasons 13 and 14, Sladen appeared as Sarah Jane, with Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor, in the audio play The Pescatons, released on LP by The Decca Record Company Limited in 1976. She also appeared with Baker in \"The Time Machine\", episode three of the BBC Radio 4 series Exploration Earth broadcast on 4 October 1976. Also in 1976 she appeared as Sarah Jane alongside Tom Baker\\'s Doctor in the first ever BBC Enterprises audio spin-off from Doctor Who: a cassette and LP release of an abridged version of Genesis of the Daleks, narrated by Baker. Sarah Jane (played by Sladen) appeared in two BBC Radio plays starring Jon Pertwee as The Doctor in the 1990s: The Paradise of Death and The Ghosts of N-Space.\\r\\nShe also appears, voiced by Sladen, in her own range of Big Finish audio dramas, consisting of nine stories released between 2002 and 2006. This series came to an unexpected end when the character was given her own television series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, detailed above. There are loose allusions to the audio series in the television series, including Sarah Jane\\'s ownership of a Volkswagen.\\r\\nSarah Jane appears in two audio stories based on The Sarah Jane Adventures, released in November 2007 on CD: The Glittering Storm by Stephen Cole and The Thirteenth Stone by Justin Richards, with both stories read by series star Elisabeth Sladen. This is the first time that BBC Audiobooks have commissioned new content for exclusive release on audio. Further pairs of audio stories were released every year until 2010, again all read by Sladen. In 2011, two audio stories were read by Daniel Anthony and Anjii Mohindra.\\r\\nSladen\\'s daughter Sadie Miller took over the role of Sarah Jane Smith for Big Finish audio dramas in 2021, first in Return of the Cybermen in March, a reworking of Gerry Davis\\' 1974 original script which was eventually filmed as Revenge of the Cybermen, with Tom Baker as the fourth Doctor; and then in The Third Doctor Adventures in May, with Tim Treloar as the third Doctor.\\r\\nThe canonicity of Sarah Jane\\'s appearances in the audio dramas is, like all Doctor Who spin-off media, unclear, and they may not even take place in the same continuity as one another. For example, the novels\\' mention of Sarah Jane as having been married is contradicted by the later Sarah Jane Smith audio play Dreamland, and the Sarah Jane Adventures episode \"Invasion of the Bane\".\\r\\n\\r\\nReception, impact and legacy\\r\\nSarah Jane Smith was consistently voted the most popular Doctor Who companion until the advent of the new series in 2005. Even in more recent times the character has continued to vie in popularity with Rose Tyler, Donna Noble, and Ace. Sladen felt that part of her popularity was working alongside Pertwee and Baker, who were popular Doctors. Daniel Martin of The Guardian named her the best companion in 2007, writing that her \"jolly-hockey-sticks good nature\" made her so beloved. The Daily Telegraph\\'s Gavin Fuller also ranked Sarah Jane number one, praising Sladen\\'s portrayal and saying that she displayed \"great determination and bravery\".\\r\\nIn 2012, Toby Whithouse, who wrote Sarah Jane\\'s return to the series in \"School Reunion\", said she was his favourite companion from the classic series. Concerning the impact of the character, he said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Because she was a comic companion; and I think that she, more than any other before her, redefined the role of the companion. And there are elements of Sarah Jane Smith that you can see in every companion afterward down to Amy. She changed the companion from being a rather helpless hysteric to being a feisty, opinionated, strong equal to The Doctor. And, at the time, you know that was quite an extraordinary thing to do. That was not the role the companion, or women, were meant to be playing. They were meant to be playing the victim, they were meant to be decoration. I think what Lis Sladen did with that character is quite extraordinary. We forget how revolutionary she was at the time.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\\r\\nSarah Jane Smith on Tardis Wiki, the Doctor Who Wiki\\r\\nSarah Jane Smith on the BBC\\'s Doctor Who website (\"New Series\")\\r\\nSarah Jane Smith on the BBC\\'s Doctor Who website (\"Classic Series\")\\r\\nOnline TV Interview on Liverpool Reporter hosted by Jonathan Thompson with Elisabeth Sladen in 2006\\r\\nBBC Norfolk Kids: The Sarah Jane Adventures\\r\\nBBC Norfolk: Interview with Elisabeth Sladen regarding Sarah Jane Smith', 'Guy Mortier (born 24 March 1943) is a Flemish journalist and radio and television personality.

Regarding his work, Pardo has stated \"What I do is shape space and play with history that forms people\\'s sense of expectation.\"\\r\\nAt one of his earliest shows, at Los Angeles gallery Thomas Solomon\\'s Garage (1990), Pardo exhibited handyman tools he had reworked.\\r\\n4166 Sea View Lane (1998)\\r\\nIn 1993, Pardo proposed that he would build his own house as part of an exhibition for LA MoCA, blurring the lines between art and function; \"a house that is also a sculpture\". The single story, bent C-shaped redwood structure was completed in 1998, when it opened to the public as a temporary satellite space to MoCA. The house is situated on a steep hillside in Mount Washington, Los Angeles. Structurally, the house is windowless toward Sea View Lane but offers semicircular views of a lush interior garden as well as a view of the Pacific Ocean, weather-permitting, from the dining room. Pardo designed every element in the building - the lamps, furniture, tiles and garden landscaping.\\r\\nProject (2000-2001)\\r\\nPardo was commissioned to create an art work for the Dia Art Foundation at 548 W 22nd Street in Chelsea, New York in 2000. His resulting work, Project, functioned in three ways: to redesign the museum lobby, to create a substantial bookshop, and to propose an exhibition for the first-floor gallery, a traditional white cube space. The installation included wardrobe furniture for a patient\\'s room by designer Alvar Aalto, side tables by designer Marcel Breuer, high stools by designer Jasper Morrison, and a full-scale model of a 1994 Volkswagen New Beetle. Pardo preferred to work incrementally, improvising with an agreed-upon framework as the project progressed.  The exhibition brochure states:  \"Eschewing finite edges, erasing borders both literal and metaphorical, Project problematizes the interface between art, architecture, and design.\"\\r\\nReyes House (2005)\\r\\nIn 2005, Pardo was commissioned to design a house for art collectors César and Mima Reyes in Naguabo, Puerto Rico. Fashioned after 4166 Sea View Lane, the house was designed to take advantage of the location by making the space open to the surrounding Caribbean views. Pardo incorporated concrete, bright orange metal screens, colorful tiling, and a kitchen collaboratively designed with the Reyes themselves. Reyes said of Pardo, \"Jorge has an incredible sense of space. Some people have a perfect ear for music; he has perfect spatial intelligence.\"\\r\\nTecoh (2007)\\r\\nMadrazo Tecoh Project saw Pardo renovate a ruined estate an hour out of Mérida, Mexico. The site was originally a farm and factory for manufacturing sisal twine, reaching its apex of productivity in the 1920s and \\'30s. The estate gradually went into disrepair in the postwar years, following the introduction of synthetic fibers. Pardo\\'s refurbishment is founded on the history and aesthetic of the site, calling on local craftspeople for construction assistance. Like 4166 Sea View Lane, Pardo meticulously designed every aspect of the building\\'s structure and interior elements. \"Every element in Tecoh is laboriously thought over by being designed and redesigned, the formalism of the near-cubist angular surfaces further reinforcing not only the \"irregular topography\", but also the ongoing conversation so crucial to Pardo\\'s work.\". The catalogue for this project consisted of a book of photographs of the site, where Pardo superimposed glowing color fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\nPardo is represented by neugerriemschneider in Berlin, Petzel Gallery in New York and Galerie Gisela Capitain in Cologne.

He has had over twenty exhibitions in museums worldwide, and his works are present in collections, and public spaces, in countries such as Italy, France, Belgium, Yugoslavia, the United States, South Korea, Austria, Hungary, Spain, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, and Venezuela.\\r\\nHe has been recognized with important awards awards, has held individual exhibitions and is represented in the collections of national museums in his country, including the Museum of Fine Arts of Caracas, the Museum of Contemporary Art of Caracas  and the National Art Gallery; as well as internationally in spaces such as the Das Klein Museum, Germany, Frank Popper Foundation, France; Satoru Sato Art Museum, Japan; Museum of Latin American Art in Los Angeles, US; the White House, US; Museum of the Arts of the University of Guadalajara. \\r\\nCarlos Medina is also known for various lines of research, always within geometry, for the exploration of different materials and techniques and also for the creation of spatial interventions and urban interventions in public spaces.\\r\\n\\r\\nEducation\\r\\nIn 1975, at the age of 22, after completing his Pure Art and Art History studies at the School of Plastic Arts Cristobal Rojas in Caracas (Escuela de Artes Plásticas Cristóbal Rojas), Carlos Medina held his first solo exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Caracas. There, he presented geometric works in iron assembly carved from Cumarebo limestone.\\r\\nIn 1977, the Italian government and the Venezuelan governmental institution FUNDARTE (Fundación para la Cultura y las Artes) awarded him a scholarship to train in Carrara, Italy, where he resided for seven years and expanded his artistic pursuits towards central Europe. During this period, Medina explored new materials, honed superior carving and turning techniques, and delved into new conceptualizations of 3D modeling work. He worked at Carlo Andrei\\'s atelier and the Gonari Marmi Industry, crafting bronze sculptures at the Pietrasanta Fonderia Artistica Mariani while attending courses at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara. \\r\\nAdditionally, Medina pursued studies in graphical techniques at the Frans Masereel Centrum in Belgium and participated in various workshops conducted by sculptors such as Sérgio de Camargo, Giò Pomodoro, Alicia Penalba, and Gonzalo Fonseca.\\r\\n\\r\\nWork\\r\\nIn 1984, Carlos Medina returned to Caracas, where he presented the exhibition \"Esculturas,\" featuring a series of more than thirty granite, marble, and travertine sculptures, alongside approximately thirty drawings and engravings executed in black and gold Indian ink. This exhibition was showcased in the Museo de Bellas Artes and the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo in Caracas, as well as in major art museums in other cities such as Barquisimeto, Porlamar, and Maracay.\\r\\nOver the subsequent decades, Medina developed more than twenty large-scale sculptures, notably the \"Fragmentos de lluvia\" (Rain fragments). One recurring project, initiated in 1989, reached its culmination in 2014 with a large-scale replica gifted to the city of Caracas. Comprising seven metallic droplets each standing at six meters high, these sculptures are now situated outdoors alongside the Francisco de Miranda Freeway, one of the Venezuelan capital\\'s main routes. Medina\\'s works also extend into the public domain, integrating spaces such as the Caracas Metro, SIDOR, and various public squares and commercial centers across the national territory.\\r\\nJournalist Alfonso Molina describes Medina as \"a reference of geometric sculpture in Venezuela, with more than 20 monumental works created,\" citing the \"Fragment of the Rain\" in Caracas as a notable example.  \\r\\nMedina\\'s oeuvre reflects influences from prominent Venezuelan masters such as Alejandro Otero, Jesús Rafael Soto, and Carlos Cruz-Diez, with whom he has exchanged ideas. American journalist David D’Arcy asserts that “Medina is heir to the geometric abstraction of the Venezuelan kineticists: Jesús-Rafael Soto, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Gego (Gertrud Goldschmidt), and Alejandro Otero.” Medina\\'s artistic evolution is characterized by his transition from early works in black iron to large-format pieces in stone, wood, and metals, culminating in his current sculptural approach, which involves suspending pieces in space and experimenting with contemporary materials to refine perceptions of lightness among aesthetic values.  \\r\\nAfter presenting his first Essential exhibition in 2009 at the Graphicart Gallery, Caracas, Carlos Medina embarked on an international traveling exhibition concept in 2012. This concept materialized in a workshop-exhibition experience at the Museum of the Arts of Guadalajara (MUSA), Mexico. Subsequently, the exhibition journeyed to various locations including Maracaibo at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Zulia, Venezuela; Miami, USA; Panama City, Panama; and the [Fernando Garcia Ponce Museum-MACAY] (Museum of Contemporary Art of Yucatán), Mexico. The exhibition integrated a series of delicate spatial interventions of Fragments of rain, Neutrinos, Threads of light, and geometric structures constructed with different techniques and materials such as wood, laser cuts, and PVC sheets.  \\r\\nArtNexus encapsulates Medina\\'s work as \"...the possibility of expressing through matter, that which transcends matter itself, the true essence of objects manifested only by the presence of the objects.\"  \\r\\nFocused on geometric abstraction, Medina\\'s work progresses from volumetric to spatial concerns, culminating in the essential and invisible interpretation of the universe and forms—central concepts exemplifying the complete evolution of his work.  \\r\\nFélix Suazo elaborates on Medina\\'s Neutrino Spheres, emphasizing notions of immateriality, emptiness, lightness, and light, while metaphorically connecting extreme powers from the microscopic to the macroscopic, from the corporeal to the incomprehensible, and from the visible to the invisible.  \\r\\nFor a visual example of Carlos Medina\\'s Neutrino Spheres, see [Fragment of Rain I on Google Arts & Culture]( https://www.carlosmedina-en.net/exhibiciones) \\r\\nOver the last decade, Medina revisited an investigation aligned with his current intention to suspend real and virtual forms through reflection, integrating and reflecting the environment, and incorporating the spectator into the work. Pieces such as “Círculo y Cuadrado” (Circle and Square), composed of stainless steel with a mirror-polished finish, exemplify this approach. Dennys Matos from ArtNexus remarks on Medina\\'s pieces, noting their ability to \"fly\" or \"float,\" connecting aesthetic and scientific discourses while conveying the inapprehensible, inexpressible experience of being in the world.  \\r\\nThe nature of Medina’s work is eloquently described by Cervantes award laureated poet Rafael Cadenas in the prologue of Belgica Rodriguez\\'s  book \"Medina: From Material to Essential,\" emphasizing the fundamental aspects of nature, reality, and attentiveness inherent in Medina\\'s artistic expression: “Medina used three words that seem fundamental to me about his work: nature, reality and attentiveness. We are surrounded by nature and also are part of it, and in fact what we do, what gives rise to culture and civilization, is the work of nature; what we call reality seems more inclusive than it, though it is still a creation of nature: we know it, but even if we go to the ends of the earth we don’t know what it is; as far as attentiveness is concerned, how much depends on exercising it! Without this one lives with one’s mind elsewhere, so one lives less. Rilke says on Rodin’s advice that he learned to see, that is, to gaze at things attentively.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\nSome of his exhibitions include:\\r\\n\\r\\nIndividual exhibitions\\r\\n2023 Neutrinos, Denise René Gallery, Paris, France\\r\\n2021 Beyond the Visible Ascaso Gallery - Miami, USA\\r\\n2019 El Arte de la Levedad (The Art of Lightness).

He has been the culture news editor of The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age since 2022.\\r\\nPreviously he was Schwartz Media\\'s head of audio, presenter of The Culture podcast, and editor of daily news podcast, 7am. He worked as the deputy editor of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation\\'s ABC Life and as a reporter with the ABC’s investigative audio program, Background Briefing, and was the former political editor at Junkee. He is also known as a contributor to The Guardian, The Saturday Paper and others.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nFaruqi was born in Pakistan and came to Australia at the age of two. He is the son of the Australian Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi. As a student at the University of New South Wales Faruqi served as the president of the Student Representative Council in 2010. In the 2015 New South Wales state election, Faruqi stood as the Australian Greens candidate for the seat of Heffron, receiving 21.1% of the first-preference vote. Faruqi is a Muslim and has commented on the difficulty of facing prejudice as a Muslim in Australia in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\\r\\nIn addition to his work as a journalist, Faruqi has also worked as a higher education policy adviser for the Australian Greens in the office of NSW Senator Lee Rhiannon. After nearly ten years as an active member of the Greens, Faruqi stepped down from his roles in the party in 2015.\\r\\nHe chairs an awards panel for the State Library of New South Wales.\\r\\nAs of 2020 Faruqi was writing a book about race relations in Australia, which was expected to be published in 2021.\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalistic career\\r\\nFaruqi frequently writes on issues related to Australian politics, culture, and identity. He frequently writes on matters related to racial, ethnic and cultural identity in Australia, including the government\\'s approach to Black Lives Matter, anti-Muslim sentiment in Australia, and the threat of far-right terrorism in Australia.\\r\\nFaruqi has written critically about the response to COVID-19 in Victoria. He has criticised the application of compliance fines for breaches of COVID-19 regulations, arguing that these have been disproportionately targeted at migrant and Indigenous Australians.\\r\\nFaruqi has been highly critical of what he calls \"racist fear mongering\" in Australian media coverage of the purported \"African gangs\" issue in Melbourne. Faruqi has noted that senior police officials in Victoria have expressed skepticism about the claim of a widespread crisis related to crime committed by African Australians in Melbourne.\\r\\nIn an extended essay for Meanjin in 2016, Faruqi was highly critical of what he perceived as inadequate ethnic diversity in Australian media. In 2018, Faruqi publicly criticised his fellow ABC journalist Sarah Ferguson for interviewing far-right figure and former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, contending that she failed to properly interrogate Bannon\\'s extreme views on race, and had \"thrown me and other PoC (people of colour) under the bus\".\\r\\nDespite his background as a former Australian Greens candidate and advisor, Faruqi criticised the party in 2016, saying it needed to \"re-evaluate and radically overhaul its current approach\" in order to escape minor party status.\\r\\nIn the wake of the Christchurch massacre, Faruqi was critical of what he perceived a political climate of \"normalising hatred and racism\" that had led to far-right radicalisation in Australia. In August 2018, Faruqi was doxxed by a far-right activist and was \"inundated with racist text message and phone calls\". He was targeted on Twitter before he deleted his Twitter account.\\r\\n\\r\\nDefamation case\\r\\nIn 2018, Faruqi successfully sued former Australian Labor Party leader and current One Nation NSW Senator Mark Latham for defamation. Latham had accused Faruqi of \"aiding and abetting Islamic terrorism\" and fostering \"anti-white racism in Australia\" in a broadcast of his online politics show Mark Latham\\'s Outsiders made on 2 August 2017. The following day, the Daily Mail ran a story broadcasting Latham\\'s comments, including a subheading claiming Faruqi and fellow Australian Muslim Yassmin Abdel-Magied were \"giving encouragement to terrorist fanatics who kill innocent people\". Faruqi subsequently received a torrent of online abuse, including death threats. When interviewed later by The Monthly, Faruqi said that \"being accused of being a terrorist when you’re a brown guy from a Muslim background in Australia is a pretty scary thing\". Latham\\'s protracted 76-page defence was described by the judge as \"extraordinary\" and drew ridicule in the Australian press its length and incoherence.\\r\\nIn the wake of the judgment, Faruqi stated that he hoped that the case would demonstrate that \"while robust debate is part of a healthy democracy, using your platform to harm the reputation of individuals comes at a cost\".\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nOsman Faruqi\\'s profile on The Guardian', 'New York City has been called the media capital of the world.

In 2014, Olafur and his long-time collaborator – German architect Sebastian Behmann – founded Studio Other Spaces, an office for architecture and art.\\r\\nOlafur represented Denmark at the 50th Venice Biennale in 2003 and later that year installed The Weather Project, which has been described as \"a milestone in contemporary art\", in the Turbine Hall of Tate Modern, London.\\r\\nOlafur has engaged in a number of public projects, including the intervention Green river, carried out in various cities between 1998 and 2001; the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion 2007, London, a temporary pavilion designed with the Norwegian architect Kjetil Trædal Thorsen; and The New York City Waterfalls, commissioned by Public Art Fund in 2008. Olafur also created the Breakthrough Prize trophy. Like much of his work, the sculpture explores the common ground between art and science. It is molded into the shape of a toroid, recalling natural forms found from black holes and galaxies to seashells and coils of DNA.\\r\\nOlafur was a professor at the Berlin University of the Arts from 2009 to 2014 and has been an adjunct professor at the Alle School of Fine Arts and Design in Addis Ababa since 2014. His studio is based in Berlin, Germany.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife and career\\r\\nEarly life and education\\r\\nOlafur Eliasson was born in Copenhagen in 1967 to Elías Hjörleifsson and Ingibjörg Olafsdottir. His parents had emigrated to Copenhagen from Iceland in 1966, his father to find work as a cook and his mother as a seamstress. He was 8 when his parents separated. He lived with his mother and his stepfather, a stockbroker. His father, then an artist, moved back to Iceland, where their family spent summers and holidays.\\r\\nAt 15, Olafur had his first solo show where he exhibited landscape drawings and gouaches at a small alternative gallery in Denmark. However, Olafur considered his \"break-dancing\" during the mid-1980s to be his first artworks. With two school friends, he formed a group that called themselves the Harlem Gun Crew and with whom he performed at clubs and dance halls for four years, eventually winning the Scandinavian championship.\\r\\nOlafur studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1989 to 1995. In 1990, when he was awarded a travel budget by the Royal Danish Academy, Olafur went to New York where he started working as a studio assistant for artist Christian Eckart in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and reading texts on phenomenology and Gestalt psychology.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtistic career\\r\\nOlafur received his degree from the academy in 1995, after having moved in 1993 to Cologne for a year, and then to Berlin, where he has since maintained a studio. First located in a three-story former train depot right next door to the Hamburger Bahnhof, the studio moved to a former brewery in Prenzlauer Berg in 2008.\\r\\nIn 1996, Olafur started working with Einar Thorsteinn, an architect and geometry expert 25 years his senior as well as a former friend of Buckminster Fuller. The first piece they created called 8900054, was a stainless-steel dome 30 feet (9.1 m) wide and 7 feet (2.1 m) high, designed to be seen as if it were growing from the ground. Though the effect is an illusion, the mind has a hard time believing that the structure is not part of a much grander one developing from deep below the surface. Thorsteinn\\'s knowledge of geometry and space has been integrated into Olafur\\'s artistic production, often seen in his geometric lamp works as well as his pavilions, tunnels and camera obscura projects.\\r\\nFor many projects, the artist works collaboratively with specialists in various fields, among them the architects Thorsteinn and Sebastian Behmann (both of whom have been frequent collaborators, Behmann working on the Kirk Kapital headquarters on Vejle Fjord in Denmark, completed in 2018), author Svend Åge Madsen (The Blind Pavilion), landscape architect Gunther Vogt (The Mediated Motion), architecture theorist Cedric Price (Chaque matin je me sens différent, chaque soir je me sens le même), and architect Kjetil Thorsen (Serpentine Gallery Pavilion, 2007). Studio Olafur Eliasson, which the artist founded as a \"laboratory for spatial research\", employs a team of architects, engineers, craftsmen, and assistants (some 30 members as of 2008) who work together to conceive and construct artworks such as installations and sculptures, as well as large-scale projects and commissions. Olafur is influenced by Bruce Nauman, as well as James Turrell and Robert Irwin.\\r\\nAs professor at the Berlin University of the Arts, Olafur Eliasson founded the Institute for Spatial Experiments (Institut für Raumexperimente, IfREX), which opened within his studio building in April 2009. Huffington Post named Olafur one of \"18 green artists who are making climate change and conservation a priority.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected works and projects\\r\\nBeauty (1993)\\r\\nNadine Wojcik, after attending the In real life exhibition in 2019, dubbed Beauty (1993) a \"simple yet powerful water installation that evokes a rainbow via spotlights.” Anna Souter called the work \"a reminder of the intensely fragile beauty of the natural world and its elements. [...]  it’s simply and superbly beautiful\".\\r\\n\\r\\nVentilator pieces\\r\\nEarly works by Olafur consist of oscillating electric fans hanging from the ceiling. Ventilator (1997) swings back and forth and around, rotating on its axis. Quadrible light ventilator mobile (2002–2007) is a rotating electrically powered mobile comprising a searchlight and four fans blowing air around the exhibition room and scanning it with the light cone. In a 2008 review of the Take Your Time retrospective (at the Museum of Modern Art), Peter Schjeldahl dubbed Ventilator \"a witty finesse of the MOMA atrium’s space-splurging grandiosity\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe weather project\\r\\nThe weather project was installed at the London\\'s Tate Modern in 2003 as part of the popular Unilever series. The installation filled the open space of the gallery\\'s Turbine Hall.\\r\\nOlafur used humidifiers to create a fine mist in the air via a mixture of sugar and water, as well as a semicircular disc (reflected by the ceiling mirror to appear circular) made up of hundreds of monochromatic lamps which radiated yellow light. The ceiling of the hall was covered with a huge mirror, in which visitors could see themselves as tiny black shadows against a mass of orange light symbolizing the sun. Many visitors responded to this exhibition by lying on their backs and waving their hands and legs. Art critic Brian O\\'Doherty described this as viewers \"intoxicated with their own narcissism as they ponder themselves elevated into the sky.\"\\r\\nThe Weather Project was highly successful. Open for six months, the work reportedly attracted two million visitors, many of whom were repeat visitors. O\\'Doherty was positive about the piece when talking to Frieze magazine in 2003, saying that it was \"the first time I\\'ve seen the enormously dismal space—like a coffin for a giant—socialized in an effective way.\" The Telegraph\\'s Richard Dorment praised its \"beauty and power\". It remains his most famous work and ranked 11th in a poll by The Guardian of the best art since 2000, with Jonathan Jones describing Olafur as \"one of the century’s most significant artists.\". The Weather Project attempted to give viewers the impression that they were near the sun inside the clouds, but in actuality, a large semicircle was suspended from a mirror ceiling, giving the impression that the reflection was a full circle. The mirrors on the ceiling produced the image of the space below that was visible. The audience completed the effect by frequently being observed lying down on their backs, staring at the ceiling, and making various motions to observe their reflections. This was done by both adults and children.\\r\\n\\r\\nLight installations\\r\\nOlafur has been developing various experiments with atmospheric density in exhibition spaces. In Room For One Colour (1998), a corridor lit by low pressure sodium lamps, the participants find themselves in a room filled with monochromatic yellow light which affects their perception of colours. Another installation, 360 degrees Room For All Colours (2002), is a round light-sculpture where participants lose their sense of space and perspective, and experience being subsumed by an intense light. Olafur\\'s later installation Din blinde passager (Your blind passenger) (2010), commissioned by the Arken Museum of Modern Art, is a 90-metre-long tunnel. Entering the tunnel, the visitor is surrounded by dense fog. With visibility at just 1.5 metres, museumgoers have to use senses other than sight to orient themselves in relation to their surroundings. After attending the 2019 In real life exhibition, Souter deemed Your blind passenger one of Olafur\\'s finest works, reporting that she felt \"alone in the universe. [...] I thought I could see my own irises, flashing as a ring of blue in front of me, and I could hear my own heartbeat in my ears.\" For Feelings are facts, the first time Olafur has worked with Chinese architect Yansong Ma as well as his first exhibition in China, Olafur introduces condensed banks of artificially produced fog into the gallery of Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing. Hundreds of fluorescent lights are installed in the ceiling as a grid of red, green, and blue zones.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreen river\\r\\nIn 1998, Olafur discovered that uranin, a readily available nontoxic powder used to trace leaks in plumbing systems, could dye entire rivers a sickly fluorescent green. Olafur conducted a test run in the Spree River during the 1998 Berlin Biennale, scattering a handful of powder from a bridge near Museum Island. He began introducing the environmentally safe dye to rivers in Moss, Norway (1998), Bremen (1998), Los Angeles (1999), Stockholm (2000) and Tokyo (2001) — always without advance warning. He first achieved international prominence with Green river, which initially made Stockholm pedestrians concerned that the city\\'s water had been tainted.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Riverbed Inside the Museum\\r\\nAt Denmark\\'s Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in 2014–2015, Olafur created a riverbed installation. He compiled natural rocks, dirt, and water to transform the gallery space into a landscape and titled the piece, “A Riverbed Inside the Museum.” Olafur captures physical phenomena in a way that appears both real and slightly artificial, while contained in a constructed space that invites viewers to participate. A Riverbed Inside the Museum becomes an immersive experience, using all five senses, in which the individuals can either follow or curiously step away from. Freedom exists in both of these actions, allowing the participant to discover a paradox or enter a void, questioning their true freedom and will happening within a designed system.\\r\\nIn a 2014 review of the exhibition, Svava Riesto and Henriette Steiner said that Olafur \"cuts us off from the surroundings and imports a different and rough beauty\"; they described the view of the stony landscape as \"meticulously framed\". However, they also speculated that Olafur aimed to make viewers see Louisiana differently and failed, creating a work that differs little from Louisiana: \"The question about [...] how it really made us see things in new ways is still unanswered.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIceland photographs\\r\\nIn regular intervals, Olafur presents grids of various color photographs, all taken in Iceland. Each group of images focuses on a single subject: volcanoes, hot springs and huts isolated in the wilderness. In his very first series he attempted to shoot all of Iceland\\'s bridges. A later series from 1996 documented the aftermath of a volcanic eruption under the Vatnajökull. Often these photographs are shot from the air, in a small rented plane traditionally used by mapmakers. Arranged in a grid, the photographs recall the repetitive images of the German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour black horizon\\r\\nThis project, a light installation commissioned for the Venice Biennale by Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary in collaboration with British architect David Adjaye, was shown from 1 August to 31 October 2005 on the island of San Lazzaro in the lagoon near Venice, Italy. A temporary pavilion was constructed on the grounds of the monastery to house the exhibit, consisting of a square room painted black with one source of illumination–a thin, continuous line of light set into all four walls of the room at the viewers eye-level, serving as a horizontal division between above and below. In 2007, the pavilion was relocated to the island of Lopud, Croatia near the city of Dubrovnik. Since then, it has on several occasions reopened to the public.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour mobile expectations: BMW H2R project\\r\\nOlafur was commissioned by BMW in 2007 to create the sixteenth art car for the BMW Art Car Project. Based on the hydrogen-powered BMW H2R concept vehicle, Olafur and his team removed the automobile\\'s alloy body and instead replaced it with a new interlocking framework of reflective steel bars and mesh. Layers of ice were created by spraying approximately 530 gallons of water during a period of several days upon the structure. On display, the frozen sculpture is glowing from within. Your mobile expectations: BMW H2R project was on special display in a temperature controlled room at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art from 2007 to 2008 and at the Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich, in 2008.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe New York City Waterfalls\\r\\nOlafur was commissioned by The Public Art Fund to create four man-made waterfalls, called The New York City Waterfalls, ranging in a height from 90 to 120 ft., in New York Harbor. The installation ran from 26 June through 13 October 2008. At $15.5 million, it was the most expensive public arts project since Christo and Jeanne-Claude\\'s installation of The Gates in Central Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Parliament of Reality\\r\\nDedicated on 15 May 2009, this permanent sculpture stands at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, NY. The installation is based on the original Icelandic parliament, Althingi, one of the world\\'s earliest democratic forums. The artist envisions the project as a place where students and visitors can gather to relax, discuss ideas, or have an argument. The parliament of reality emphasizes that negotiation should be the core of any educational scheme. The man-made island is surrounded by a 30-foot circular lake, 24 trees, and wild grasses. The 100-foot-diameter (30 m) island is composed of a cut-bluestone, compass-like floor pattern (based upon meridian lines and navigational charts), on top of which 30 river-washed boulders create an outdoor seating area for students and the public to gather. The island is reached by a 20-foot-long stainless steel lattice-canopied bridge, creating the effect that visitors are entering a stage or outdoor forum. Frogs gather in this wiry mesh at night, creating an enjoyable symphony.\\r\\n\\r\\nColour experiment paintings (2009–)\\r\\nFor his ongoing series of Colour experiment paintings – which began in 2009 – Olafur started analyzing pigments, paint production and application of colour in order to mix paint in the exact colour for each nanometre of the visible light spectrum. This body of work features color wheels that are created in a variety of spectrums. He also explores the work of Caspar David Friedrich. In 2014, Olafur analyzed seven paintings by J. M. W. Turner to create Turner colour experiments, which isolate and record Turner\\'s use of light and colour.\\r\\nIn April 2023, his artwork Colour experiment no. 114 was used as the artwork for the Peter Gabriel song \"i/o\", from the forthcoming album of the same name.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarpa\\r\\nOlafur designed the facade of Harpa, Reykjavík\\'s new concert hall and conference centre which was completed in 2011. In close collaboration with his studio team and Henning Larsen Architects, the designers of the building, Olafur has designed a unique facade consisting of large quasi bricks, a stackable twelve sided module in steel and glass. The facade will reflect the city life and the different light composed by the movements of the sun and varying weather. During the night the glass bricks are lit up by different colored LED lights. The building was opened on 13 May 2011, and garnered acclaim.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour rainbow panorama\\r\\nOlafur\\'s artwork Your rainbow panorama consists of a circular, 150 metres (490 ft) long and 3 metres (9.8 ft) wide corridor made of glass in every color of the spectrum. It has a diameter of 52 metres (171 ft) and is mounted on 3.5 metres (11 ft) high columns on top of the roof of the ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum in Aarhus. It opened in May 2011. Visitors can walk through the corridor and have a panoramic view of the city.\\r\\nConstruction cost 60 million Danish kroner and was funded by the Realdania foundation.\\r\\nOlafur\\'s idea was chosen in 2007 among five other proposals in a bidding process by a panel of judges. At night the artwork is lit from the inside by spotlights in the floor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoon\\r\\nIn November 2013, at the Falling Walls Conference, Olafur presented with Ai Weiwei their collaboration Moon, an open digital platform that allows users to draw on a replica of the moon via their web browser. Eliasson presented the platform as \"a sphere on which you can make a mark. Not just to make a mark, but make a mark that matters to you. Make your wish, make your dream. Do something.\" Accessible to anyone, it attracted over 35,000 participants within the first six weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\nContact\\r\\nFrom December 17, 2014, to February 23, 2015, Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris. The artworks appear as a sequence of events along a journey. Moving through passageways and expansive installations, visitors become part of a choreography of darkness, light, geometry, and reflections. Along the way, optical devices, models, and a meteorite reflect Olafur\\'s on-going investigations into the mechanisms of perception and the construction of space.\\r\\n\\r\\nIce Watch Series\\r\\nThe relation between bodily reaction and art as well as the raising of awareness of climate change is explored in Ice Watch (2014-2018). With the installation of enormous ice blocks in various places of the world (Copenhagen in 2014, Paris in 2015 and London in 2018), Olafur responds to major Climate Change conferences and reports. With his project beginning in 2014, he transports twelve ice-blocks from the Nuup Kangerlua fjord in Greenland to the streets of Copenhagen. The ice-blocks are placed in the shape of a circle. Each ice block weighs between 1.5 and 5 tonnes. In November 2015, Olafur together with geologist Minik Rosing again transported twelve enormous blocks of ice from Greenland to Place du Panthéon in Paris. The installation was timed with the UN Climate Change Conference that was held in Paris. The installation was once again repeated in 2018, when Olafur divided a total of thirty ice-blocks between two locations in London: 24 blocks at the banks of the Tate Modern museum, and 6 blocks before the Bloomberg headquarters.\\r\\nTimothy Morton lists Ice Watch as an example of how art can help humans understand their relationship with nonhumans amidst ecological crisis, arguing that it \"seriously stretched or went beyond prefabricated concepts, in a friendly and simple, yet deep way\". Louise Hornby argued that Ice Watch has \"poignancy\" but also “funnels time and melting ice through the spectator’s own experience [...] The imperative to watch asserts the central agency of the experiencing subject\", which is unfitting because the \"glaciers will melt, whether or not we see them”.\\r\\n\\r\\nVertical Panorama Pavilion (2022)\\r\\nCommissioned by Mei and Allan Warburg for the Donum Estate\\r\\nwinery in Sonoma, California, in 2019, the Vertical Panorama Pavilion is built to accommodate up to 12 guests and inspired by the history of circular calendars. The pavilion\\'s roof features 832 laminated panels of recycled glass in 24 colors and is supported by 12 stainless-steel columns. From afar, only the translucent rainbow glass tiled canopy can be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther projects\\r\\nIn 2005-2007, Olafur and classical violin maker Hans Jóhannsson completed work on the development of a new instrument, with the objective to reinterpret the traditions of 17th- and 18th-century violin making using today\\'s technology and a contemporary visual aesthetic.\\r\\nCommissioned by Louis Vuitton in 2006, lamps titled Eye See You were installed in the Christmas windows of Louis Vuitton stores; a lamp titled You See Me went on permanent display at Louis Vuitton Fifth Avenue, New York. Each deliberately low-tech apparatus, of which there are about 400, is composed of a monofrequency light source and a parabolic mirror. All fees from the project were donated to 121Ethiopia.org, a charitable foundation initially established by Olafur and his wife to renovate an orphanage. Cynthia Zarin of The New Yorker described Your wave is (2006) as a \"major work\".\\r\\nIn 2007, Olafur developed the stage design for Phaedra, an opera production at the Berlin State Opera.\\r\\nIn a 2008 review of the Take Your Time retrospective (at the Museum of Modern Art), Peter Schjeldahl described Olafur as far superior to other \"crowd-pleasing installational artists\" of his generation; he wrote that the retrospective has some filler but also \"lovely, subtly disorienting effects\". He praised the artist as avoiding excessive political activism and Matthew Barney\\'s \"implications of mystical portent\". Schjeldahl interpreted the artist as raising awareness \"of the neurological susceptibilities that condition all of what we see and may think we know.” Reviewing the same retrospective, Lauren Weinberg of Time Out praised Beauty (1993); the \"discomfiting\" works like 1997\\'s Room for one colour and Ventilator; and the works involving the sense of smell, such as Moss wall (1994) and Soil quasi bricks (2003). She argued that Moss wall \"evokes Scandinavia more powerfully than Eliasson’s dozens of photographs of rivers, caves and other natural features of Iceland, which fill one room of the show.\"\\r\\nHis seventh solo exhibition, Volcanos and shelters at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, is about nature and specifically Iceland. In The New York Times, Roberta Smith praised it as his \"most gimmick-free [exhibition] in a while. The refreshing back-to-basics mood is a welcome break from the immersive complexities of his recent perception-altering environments.”\\r\\nAlong with James Corner\\'s landscape architecture firm Field Operations and architecture firm Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Olafur was part of the design team for New York\\'s High Line park. Olafur was originally supposed to create an outdoor-based artwork for the 2012 Summer Olympics; however, his proposed £1 million ($1.6 million) project Take A Deep Breath – which involved recording people breathing – was rejected due to funding problems.\\r\\nIn 2012 Olafur and engineer Frederik Ottesen founded Little Sun, a company that produces solar powered LED lamps.\\r\\nIn 2014 it was announced that his work Kissing Earth, representing two globes, was to be placed in front of the newly built Rotterdam Centraal train station in the Netherlands. After protests by Rotterdam residents and concerns over the expected costs the impopular project was cancelled in 2016. The square in front of the station remained empty.\\r\\nIt was reported in October 2019 that Olafur was commissioned by the German government to create a \"pan-European work of art\" for the German European Council presidency in the second half of 2020.\\r\\nLaura Cumming awarded the In real life survey four out of five stars, especially praising Your blind passenger. She found some of the art (like the ice boulders from Greenland) didactic but still wrote, \"Each piece conveys the strange extremes of Iceland with all the condensed power of a sonnet\". Anna Souter, however, expressed a lukewarm view of the In real life exhibition in Hyperallergic, writing that Room for one colour was more powerful at London\\'s National Gallery than at Tate Modern and that Your uncertain shadow (colour) (2010) \"feels like little more than a clever, visual trick.\" She also reported that some in the art world find Olafur\\'s work unsettling because \"[m]ost people like Olafur Eliasson, and many curators and critics don’t like it when most people like the same things they do.\"\\r\\nOlafur\\'s AR Wunderkammer project, available through an app, is being used to place objects in the user\\'s environment. These objects include burning suns, extraterrestrial rocks, and rare animals.\\r\\nAccording to The Guardian, the works by Olafur that he considers highlights are Five Dimensional Pavilion (1998), Model room (2003), Sphere (2003), Your Invisible House (2003), The Parliament of Reality (2006–09), the facades of Harpa (2005–11), Your Rainbow Panorama (2006-2011), the 2007 Serpentine Gallery Pavilion, Colour activity house (2010), The Triangular Sky (2013), and Cirkelbroen (2015). He deemed Beauty (1993) and The presence of absence pavilion (2019) the highlights of the 2019–2020 In real life exhibition.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\nOlafur had his first solo show was with Nicolaus Schafhausen in Cologne in 1993, before moving to Berlin in 1994. In 1996, Olafur had his first show in the United States at Tanya Bonakdar Gallery. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) organized Olafur\\'s first major survey in the United States Take Your Time: Olafur Eliasson, from September 2007 to February 2008. Curated by the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Madeleine Grynsztejn (then Elise S. Haas Senior Curator of Painting and Sculpture at SFMOMA), in close collaboration with the artist, the major survey spanned the artist\\'s career from 1993 and 2007. The exhibit included site-specific installations, large-scale immersive environments, freestanding sculpture, photography, and special commissions seen through a succession of interconnected rooms and corridors. The museum\\'s skylight bridge was turned into an installation titled One-way colour tunnel. Following its San Francisco debut, the exhibit embarked on an international tour to the Museum of Modern Art, and P.S.1. Contemporary Art Center, New York, 2008; the Dallas Museum of Art, Dallas, Texas, 2008–2009; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, 2009; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney 2009–2010.\\r\\nHe has also had major solo exhibitions at, among others, Kunsthaus Bregenz, Musée d’Art Moderne, Paris, and ZKM (Center for Art and Media), Karlsruhe (2001); Schirn Kunsthalle, Frankfurt (2004); Hara Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo (2006); the Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa, Ishikawa (2009); the Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin (2010) and the Langen Foundation, Museum Insel Hombroich, Neuss (2015). Olafur has also appeared in numerous group exhibitions, including the São Paulo Biennial and the Istanbul Biennial (1997), Venice Biennale (1999, 2001 and 2005), and the Carnegie International (1999), Palace of Versailles (2016), The Parliament of Possibilities at Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art (2016-2017).\\r\\nFrom July 2019 to through to January 2020, Tate Modern showed the exhibition In real life.\\r\\n\\r\\nCollections\\r\\nOlafur\\'s work is held in the following permanent collections:\\r\\n\\r\\nSolomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York\\r\\nCentre for International Light Art (CILA), Unna, Germany\\r\\nMuseum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles\\r\\nColección Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards\\r\\nThe Spiral Pavilion, conceived in 1999 for the Venice Biennale and today on display at Kunsthalle Bielefeld, brought Olafur Eliasson the Benesse Prize by the Benesse Corporation. In 2004, Olafur won the Nykredit Architecture Prize and the Eckersberg Medal for painting. The following year he was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal for sculpture and in 2006, the Crown Prince Couple\\'s Culture Prize. In 2006, he received the Austrian Frederick Kiesler Prize for Architecture and the Arts. In 2007, he was awarded the first Joan Miró Prize by the Joan Miró Foundation.\\r\\nIn 2010, Olafur was the recipient of a Quadriga award. He returned his award one year later after it was revealed that Vladimir Putin would be recognized in 2011. In October 2013, he was honored with the Goslarer Kaiserring. That same year, Olafur and Henning Larsen Architects were recipients of the Mies van der Rohe Award for their Harpa Concert Hall and Conference Center in Reykjavik, Iceland.\\r\\nIn 2014, Olafur was the recipient of the $100,000 Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). The prize is considered an investment in the recipient\\'s future creative work, rather than a prize for a particular project or lifetime of achievement. The awardee becomes an artist in residence at MIT, studying and teaching for a period of time.\\r\\nOn the occasion of a state visit to Germany in June 2013, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, visited Studio Olafur Eliasson in Berlin.\\r\\nBrazilian filmmaker Karim Aïnouz\\'s documentary piece, Domingo, shot from his encounter with Olafur during the 17th Videobrasil Festival, had its world premiere at Rio International Film Festival] in 2014, and was released on DVD in 2015.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal life\\r\\nIn 2003, Olafur married the Danish art historian Marianne Krogh Jensen, whom he met when she curated the Danish Pavilion for the 1997 São Paulo Art Biennial. They adopted both their son (in 2003) and their daughter (in 2006) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The family had lived in a house designed by architect Andreas Lauritz Clemmensen in Hellerup near Copenhagen, but Olafur and Jensen are no longer married. Olafur currently lives and works in Berlin. Olafur speaks Icelandic, Danish, German, and English. He also has a younger half-sister named Victoria Eliasdottir who is a chef.\\r\\nOn 22 September 2019, Olafur was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador by the United Nations Development Programme \"to advocate for urgent action on climate change and sustainable development goals.\" In the context of his appointment, Olafur emphasized the need to stay positive: \"I also think it\\'s important not to lose sight of what is actually going quite well. There is reason for hope. I believe in hope as such and I\\'m generally a positive person. And when you think about it: it has never been better to be a young African girl, for instance.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nList of exhibitions by Olafur Eliasson\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nFurther reading\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial website\\r\\nVideo of Olafur Eliasson conference: The Sun has no money\\r\\nMoMA 2008: Olafur Eliasson: take your time (requires Flash Player)\\r\\n1998 article from frieze\\r\\nTate Modern: The Weather Project\\r\\nSFMOMA 2007: Olafur Eliasson Survey\\r\\n\\'Take Your Time: Olafur Eliasson\\' at SFMOMA (requires Flash Player)\\r\\nOlafur Eliasson: Your Mobile Expectations\\r\\nOlafur Eliasson at the Fundación NMAC\\r\\nA Riverbed Inside The Museum.

He originally studied to be an architect at the University of Montevideo, but discovered modern art in 1942 after working in the Taller Torres-Garcia workshop.  He studied painting in the workshop until 1949, and became interested in pre-Columbian art during that time. Fonseca is frequently associated with the movement Universal Constructivism.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nFonseca was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, in July 1922. He traveled to Europe in the 1930s, and was exposed to archaeology, anthropology, and history. Fonseca also taught himself to sculpt in stone and paint with watercolor. In 1939, he began studying architecture at the University of Montevideo. However, in 1942 Fonseca left the University to work with Joaquín Torres-García. While working at the Torres-Garcia workshop, he became more diverse in his techniques, trying sculpting, painting, ceramics, and drawing. During the course of the 1940s, Fonseca traveled through Peru and Bolivia, studying art with other members of the Torres-Garcia workshop.\\r\\nIn 1950 he left Uruguay, and traveled through several countries in Europe and the Middle East. Fonseca worked in excavations run by Flinders Petrie in Egypt, Sudan, Syria, and traveled through Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Greece. These archeological digs would prove fundamental in his future artworks. While living in Europe, he worked in ceramics as well as painting.\\r\\nHe met and married Elizabeth Kaplan, from New York City, in the mid-1950s (and divorced two decades later) and moved to Manhattan in 1958 after being awarded a Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. He had four children, Quina, Bruno, Caio, and Isabel with Elizabeth Kaplan, two of whom (Bruno Fonseca and Caio Fonseca) became renowned artists. Their youngest child Isabel Fonseca became a writer.\\r\\nIn 1962 Fonseca had his first exhibition in the United States, at the Portland Art Museum in Oregon. This exhibition contained mostly flat compositions, as was common with the works done by the Torres-Garcia workshop at that time. Fonseca also created wooden reliefs for this exhibition, which laid a foundation for his three-dimensional art. He began working in New York and in Italy, near Carrara. It is in the 1970s that he focuses on painting towards sculpture and on three-dimensional architectural forms. He started working on large scale pieces mostly of marble, and recycled limestone from New York\\'s demolished buildings. In 1983, he became a citizen of the United States. During the late 1970s and 1980s he became more focused on towers, such as Torre del recien nacido (\"Tower of the Newborn Child\") and Torre de los vientos. He had few solo shows throughout his career, but several group exhibitions in which he became known for his stone sculptures of modern influenced architectural forms.  He died in Italy at the age of 74 in Seravezza, Italy, in his studio.\\r\\n\\r\\nIconology\\r\\nAs a Universal Constructivist, Fonseca sought to focus on art outside of nationality. This is clear in the amount of traveling and excavating he did, not trying to define a national identity but rather a universal identity, free of false stereotypes.\\r\\nFonseca\\'s influence on his art derived from a fascination with history and cultures, and his early training as an architect helped him realize and formulate his sculptures.  His pieces offer a sense of mystery, and yet a deeper meaning.\\r\\nFonseca\\'s sculptures take architectural reference as well as that of ancient ruins and what he studied while taking part in excavations.  This causes the viewer to recognize and identify parts of the sculpture, perhaps relating them to the characteristics of a building or home.  But the way in which he manifests these pieces still leaves something to be defined by the viewer in relation to time and space.  His works do not automatically construct a definite time period in the viewer\\'s mind, leaving it to the imagination as to what it may or may not represent in time and space.\\r\\nFonseca was very interested in the nature and history of the stones used in his sculpture. While working in the quarries, he would notice the changes in the stone due to climate. It is said that the fragile nature of many of these stones is why Fonseca had so few exhibitions: sand did not travel well.\\r\\nFonseca\\'s sculpture has two clear features. The first is the intimacy that causes one to relate innately to his works. The other feature is the grandeur in his sculpture, strengthened by the simplicity of the geometric forms. His art is known as \"a journey through the history of archeology.\" The archeological basis stems from Precolombian architecture as well as Eastern Mediterranean, and even New York City architecture. It was clear that archeology spread through all of Fonseca\\'s work.\\r\\nFonseca\\'s artworks also tend to be a labyrinth of thought. Some of the works contain inscriptions that may give a glimpse, but do not truly allow much insight into his mind. There are many stairways and ladders in his sculptures, which lead to tombs such as the quarries he worked in. Fonseca shared that these ladders also show the \"descent into the infernos.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected artworks\\r\\nTorre de los vientos (\"Tower of the Winds\"), 1974.\\r\\nThis sculpture was constructed as a tribute to the Greek architect Andronicus. Andronicus had built a tower in Athens to commemorate the gods of the winds. Fonseca\\'s tribute had four sides, each side with Latin inscriptions indicating the four different kinds of winds in Greek mythology.  The four winds are the North wind known as Boreas, which brought hail; the East morning wind known as Eurus; the South wind known as Noto, which brought sorrow; and the mild wind from the West known as Zephirus, which was feared by the sailors. The dome on top likely symbolizes the center of the world, with its inscription Onphalos.\\r\\nEl Pilar (\"The Pilar\"), 1986, 1990, 1997.\\r\\nThis sculpture was precisely carved and was placed in three separate contexts: Seravezza, Italy, Pietrasanta, Italy, and the entrance of Uruguay\\'s Pavilion at the XLIV Biennale Di Venezia. It contains a ladder, which is common in Fonseca\\'s work, which is known to relate to both the Hebrew ladder of Jacob and also the ladders in the quarries he excavated in.\\r\\nColumbarium Major, 1976. \\r\\nThis sculpture is known for its contrast in change of scale. There are multiple cuts into the wood filled with geometric forms, as well as his well-known stairways. This artwork also contains \"betilos\", known as sacred stones.\\r\\nLa Casa (\"The House\"), 1963.\\r\\nThis artwork was a relief painting with engravings of ladders and figures. It also included wood-carved objects hanging from the top corner of the painting.\\r\\nGraneros III, 1971–1975.\\r\\nThis work was part of horizontal, heavy slabs that were displayed as urban projects for participants to interact with. It was carved of red travertine marble.  It mimics the form of an actual grain store, but also refers to a store of knowledge, with the grain representing the knowledge.\\r\\n\\r\\nXIX Olympiad\\r\\nFonseca designed and created a 12-meter high concrete tower as his contribution to the Route of Friendship (Spanish: La Ruta de la Amistad) of the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.  It was titled Torre.  This structure recalls the shape of the Malwiya, the spiral minaret of the Great Mosque of Samarra.  It is hollow, and was later converted into a studio, then used as an artists\\' exhibition space from 1997 to 2004.\\r\\nThe XIX Olympiad was significant in that these were the first Olympic Games held in Latin America. The \"Route of Friendship\" contained nineteen concrete sculptures on the highway surrounding the capital.

He completed his elementary and high school education in the San Jose School of Asunción and his engineering studies in Buenos Aires where he also graduated as a sculptor at the Escuela Superior de Bellas Artes “ Ernesto de la Cárcova”, coming  into contact with artists Libero Badii, Alicia Peñalba, Lucio Fontana and Curatella Manes and  learning to value the avant-garde movements of the time.\\r\\nAfter the bloody civil war of 1947-1954  in Paraguay, Guggiari\\'s liberal and democratic ideas gained him exile, cultural margination and imprisonment on several occasions, during the thirty-year dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner.\\r\\nThe lack of an official  national art fair in Paraguay led him to create the “Bosque de los artistas”, in his own property, a fair which opened every Christmas from 1970 to 1995 becoming a Must of artistic creators, reaching a participation of  250 artists in the last editions.\\r\\n\\r\\nHistory and works\\r\\nGuggiari\\'s body of work is large and has won prizes. Some have freedom as the central theme: ”Hungria o Libertad“, which received a special mention in the V Bienal of São Paulo (1959); ”Kennedy”, which obtained the first prize in sculpture in the Salon Esso of Young Artist of Latin America, organized by the OEA (1965): ”Rejas”, inspired in the prisons of the Stronist dictatorship; ”NNUU”, a seven meters structure, which is located at the entrance of the Dachau concentration camp (Germany) and symbolizes the United Nations in a form near the building of the NNUU, with perforations as wounds in two fronts-United Nations as a name, because the violence of the world continues-and as a sign of hope in each hole of the violence, a nest of  real pigeons as a murmur of peace (199).\\r\\nAnother theme is the vital, between to be and stop being. In this line there is ”Parto”, with a message of transcendence despite the pain, ”Inmanencia”, and “Del polvo eres y polvo seras”.\\r\\nAs a homage to the dreams that did not come true, what could not be, he carved “Ara rupi a” about which Livio Abramo said once at the presentation: ”Because of the capacity of adapting is deep  artistic sensibility to the spirit of this time, Hermann B. Guggiari has a special place in the plastic art of Paraguay and the continent. His art is complex, absorbing all technical possibilities of our culture and civilization and he fuses them as his instrument in order to express the fundamental values of men.”\\r\\n“Brote”, an homage to his father, mayor of the city of Asunción who planted trees and created the green spaces of the city, is a sculpture inscribed within his optimistic themes. ”Historia”, presented at the Expo 92 in Sevilla, was selected by the organizers of the world event to be exposed at the entrance of the “Pabellon de las Americas”. His moral theme appeared in his “Cristo“, whose original is at the entrance of the church La Crucecita, in the Sajonia neighborhood, in Asunción. A copy of this work was presented at the X Bienal of São Paulo (1971) and obtained the Golden Medal; regarding this successful participation the critic Arnold Kohler, from Switzerland, said in the newspaper Tribune de Geneve: ” There are two artist in the Bienal of Sao Paulo, both sculptors, who having followed different steps, one figurative and the other abstract, have reached a high perfection and spirituality. The first one, Hermann Guggiari, Paraguayan-created a form of an angel emerging  from the wall, a dramatic and sublime work.“\\r\\nHe is also the author of other “Cristos“, associated to the ecological area, such as the one in the temple of Maria Auxiliadora, of Asunción, and the “Cristo clavado por los troncos quemados”, of the few remaining woods in Paraguay. Within this subject, he made in the streets, in the second Bienal of Medellin (Colombia), the “Cross” of Medellin, as an homage to the Colombian Christian martyrs. Another “Cruz ametrallada” made as an homage to the Christian country men of the agro leagues, murdered during the dictatorship of Stroessner. “Proceso” deserves special mention atemporal multispatial, with an integration of films, photos, sound, made with machine guns and used several times as “Cruz”.\\r\\nOn sustained development he presented in the university city of Fort Hays, Kansas, United States, a sculpture symbolizing the development of this state as the world granary.

The movement was characterised by the production of free-standing statues and statuettes of \\'ideal\\' figures from poetry or mythology. These figures were usually in bronze but a mixture of materials, such as ivory and gem stones, to give a polychromic effect, were also used. \"New Sculpture\" is most closely associated with the period from 1880 to 1910, although some artists continued to work in the style much further into the 20th-century.\\r\\nThe term \"New Sculpture\" was coined by the art critic Edmund Gosse, who wrote a four-part series for The Art Journal in 1894. After a protracted period of a stylized neoclassicism, sculpture in the last quarter of the century began to explore a greater degree of naturalism and wider range of subject matter. The French sculptor Jules Dalou, in his eight-year English exile after the Paris Commune events in 1871, taught modelling at the South Kensington School of Art, and then at the Lambeth School of Art. He profoundly influenced a new generation of British sculptors, helping to usher in a new approach to the medium.\\r\\nThe catalyst for this development is usually understood to be the exhibition, in 1877, of Frederic Leighton\\'s An Athlete Wrestling with a Python.  This was Leighton\\'s first major sculpture, and he intended it as a challenge to the prevailing styles of sculpture.  It reflected his interest in a more dynamic and vibrant representation of the human body and a shift from easily legible and didactic subject matter.  Many sculptors looked to the Athlete and created responses to it in the following years.\\r\\nThe New Sculpture represents an alternate formulation of a new direction for sculpture at the end of the nineteenth century.  Whereas the major French alternative to mid-19th-century sculpture, Auguste Rodin, increasingly left the accurate representation of the human body behind, the New Sculptors by and large chose to grapple with issues arising from the naturalistic representation of the body and the detailed rendering of its surface variations.  The New Sculpture does not represent one singular style, but rather a range of options developed to make sculpture more vital and lifelike.\\r\\nA small exhibition dedicated to the New Sculpture was held at Tate Britain during the summer and early autumn of 2010.

New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982.', 'Alfredo Jim�nez Mota (February 16, 1980  � disappeared April 2, 2005) was a 25-year-old Mexican journalist, working for El Imparcial (Hermosillo) in the northern city of Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, who went missing while investigating government involvement with organized crime and drug traffickers in Sinaloa during the Mexican Drug War. Journalist Jos� Reveles reported in his book, El c�rtel inc�modo: El fin de los Beltr�n Leyva y la hegemon�a del Chapo Guzm�n, that Ra�l Guti�rrez Parra, who was also later killed, ordered Los G�eros to murder Jim�nez Mota as his investigations interfered with the flow of drugs through Sinaloa.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal\\r\\nAlfredo Jim�nez Mota was born on February 16, 1980, in Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico, where he continued to reside as a career minded bachelor. He is the only son of Esperanza Mota Martinez and Jose Alfredo Jim�nez Hernandez, and the only brother of Leticia, his sister. Jim�nez Mota began his work in the state of Sinaloa upon earning his degree at the Universidad de Occidente in Culiac�n, in Communication. The Jim�nez family are Catholic and attended Cristo Rey de Empalme, where Jim�nez Mota sang in the choir. In his early years, Jim�nez Mota enjoyed boxing, weighing in at 240-pounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nThe career of Alfredo Jim�nez Mota\\' began in newspapers while he was still a student in Culiac�n, where he worked for El Sol de Culiac�n, El Debate and Noroeste, Sinaloa. and began to report in the genre of the nota roja (tabloid-style crime stories). He was also director of social communication at the Attorney General Office of Culiac�n, Sinaloa. In late 2004, Jim�nez Mota joined El Imparcial, where he often wrote stories dangerous enough that editors did not want to print his byline but Jim�nez Mota insisted on the credit. He disappeared five months into his employment.\\r\\n\\r\\nDisappearance\\r\\nPrior to his disappearance, Jim�nez Mota was investigating the government\\'s involvement in drug trafficking in the region of Sinaloa and possible involvement with the Beltr�n Leyva and Sinaloa cartels, the latter involving drug lords Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada Garc�a and Joaqu�n \"El Chapo\" Guzm�n. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration was also investigating drug trafficking into the US from this northern border region. On April 2, 2005, Jim�nez Mota was being followed and photographed, which led to him seeking refuge at Los Grillos, a restaurant at Hidalgo Square, until he could safely make his way back to his office. Prior to this incident he was receiving death threats from an unknown source which led to his vigilance on the job and in his personal life. It was later this same evening when Jim�nez Mota disappeared, never to be seen nor heard from again. According to his friends and colleagues, Jim�nez Mota failed to show up for drinks at a restaurant where they planned to speak about their days events. During his investigations, Jim�nez Mota caused a stir in the State Attorney General\\'s office by his persistence. He also angered the Police Chief while examining connections between the department and local drug trafficking. There are conflicting accounts on what happened the evening Jim�nez Mota went missing. In one account, there is a letter which states the remains of Jim�nez Mota could be found in one of three \"safe houses\" in Villa Itson. In another account, two women who claim to have been kidnapped but got away, say they overheard their captors speaking of Jim�nez Mota being held at the same location prior to his execution. The remains of Jim�nez Mota have yet to be found, no perpetrators have been charged, and the case remains unsolved.\\r\\n\\r\\nContext\\r\\nIn an effort to silence reporters, Mexico ranks 11th of all countries, and 1st in Latin countries in cartel-related homicides of journalists. While there are many suspects in the disappearance of Alfredo Jim�nez Mota, the case has never been solved. In November 2005, a suspect Ra�l Enrique Parra and drug trafficker was brutally murdered.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact\\r\\nJim�nez Mota\\'s disappearance marked the first case of missing or murdered journalists in Hermosillo, the capitol of the state of Sonora. Within days of his disappearance the Inter American Press Association (IAPA) and Rapid Response Unit (URR) began to investigate. The IAPA demanded all authorities get involved in an effort to stop the murder of journalists and to support the effort of freedom of expression. The case was taken to the Deputy Attorney General for Specialized Investigation in Organized Crime (SIEDO) where they vowed the case would be resolved. The IAPA and over 40 newspaper directors met in August 2005 to discuss solutions and build strength in journalism. While the reporting arm of this group�called the Phoenix Group after a similar investigative project in the United States after Don Bolles was murdered by the mafia�revealed federal and state officials could be involved in the disappearance of Jim�nez Mota, the administrative arm issued the \"Declaration of Hermosillo\" as a set of concrete steps the state could take to ensure the safety of journalists. With the growing intimidation of reporters, the IAPA published a map which provided journalists locations of high risk and safety issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nReactions\\r\\nThe family of Alfredo Jim�nez Mota held a memorial on the 10th anniversary of their son\\'s disappearance with memorabilia and activities. The community of Hermocillo celebrated his memory by attending the unveiling of a plaque which was placed at The Plaza del Tinaco in his honor.\\r\\nIn a letter to the Attorney General of Mexico, the Committee to Protect Journalists wrote, \"The Committee to Protect Journalists would like to express its concern about the fate of Alfredo Jim�nez Mota ... We are worried about our colleague\\'s safety. We urge you to conduct a timely and thorough investigation, locate Jim�nez, and bring him to safety. CPJ will be monitoring the investigation and respectfully asks that you make available to us any information you might have regarding this case.\"\\r\\nColleagues of Jim�nez Mota demanded the Attorney General of the Republic (PGR) to step up its investigation. The consensus in the media community was those who were possibly involved, were sweeping the case under the rug. Since the disappearance of Jim�nez Mota, the fight to \"quiet\" the press has made reporting difficult.\\r\\nKo�chiro Matsuura, director-general of UNESCO, said in a statement that also included Jim�nez Mota, \"Crimes against journalists and editors constitute a grievous offence against democracy.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards\\r\\nMota was posthumously awarded the International Editor Award 2005 for his bravery in journalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nList of people who disappeared\\r\\nList of journalists and media workers killed in Mexico\\r\\nList of kidnappings\\r\\nHuman rights in Mexico\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nColin Brayton, \"The Rubbing Out of Alfred Jim�nez Mota, Journalist\" January 24, 2007.', '', 'Jilali Gharbaoui (Arabic: الجيلالي الغرباوي; 1930–1971) was a Moroccan painter and sculptor from Jorf El Melha. He is considered, along with Ahmed Cherkaoui, a pioneer of modernist art in Morocco. Unlike other Moroccan modernist artists, his abstraction was based in brushstrokes and the \"materiality of the paint\" as opposed to Moroccan culture. Gharbaoui suffered from severe mental illness and died of suicide in Paris in 1971.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife\\r\\nHe started studying art at the Academie des Arts in Fes. He traveled to France in 1952. With the assistance of the novelist Ahmed Sefrioui, then director of fine arts in Rabat, Gharbaoui was able to attend the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He studied for four years then worked at the Académie Julian for a year.\\r\\nHe befriended the poet and painter Henri Michaux, the painters Hans Hartung and Jean Dubuffet, and the art critic Pierre Restany.\\r\\nWith a grant from the Italian government, he lived in Rome from 1958 to 1960, when he returned to Morocco. In this period he frequently went to Paris for work, and in 1959, Pierre Restany introduced Gharbaoui at the Salon Comparaisons\\u200a.\\r\\nHe was hosted often by Abbot Denis Martin at the Benedictine monastery of Toumliline, where he created wall decorations.\\r\\nDuring his life, he exhibited around Morocco and in Egypt, France, the Netherlands, the United States, and Brazil. His art appeared in the magazine Souffles-Anfas.\\r\\nHe was found dead by suicide on a public bench in the Champ de Mars in Paris in 1971. His body was repatriated and buried in Fes.\\r\\nIn 1993, the Arab World Institute in Paris hosted a retrospective exhibition dedicated to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt\\r\\nBefore he embraced abstraction in the early 1950s, Gharbaoui experimented with French Impressionism and German Expressionism.\\r\\nAccording to Toni Maraini, \"Gharbaoui’s work largely focuses on movement and nervous brush-strokes. With chromatic disorder and an automated vitality, he creates a neutral space and an active, expressive material.\"\\r\\nIn Art in the Service of Colonialism, Hamid Irbouh describes Gharbaoui and Ahmed Cherkaoui as \"bipictorialists\" in contrast with the nativists of the Casablanca School. Whereas the nativists, led by Farid Belkahia, sought to break entirely from French and Western art, the bipictorialists included Moroccan and Western influences, working toward a reconciliation of the various dimensions of postcolonial Moroccan identity.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Gustav Waldemar Sj�lander Johnson (January 6, 1908 � March 18, 1988) was a Swedish painter, printmaker and sculptor, who developed most of his career in Mexico. He immigrated to the country just after World War II, after establishing himself as an artist in his native Sweden. His career included individual exhibitions in venues such as the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico and the Konstakademin in Sweden, with his works held by museums in Mexico and Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nLife\\r\\nSj�lander was born on January 6, 1908, in Gothenburg, Sweden, the son of an engineer and inventor of locks for safes. As a child, he studied at the Free School of Fine Arts with Albert Edh and at the Valand Art School with Tor Bjurstrom. He also traveled with his father on business, which allowed him to study in other parts of Europe such as Denmark, Norway and France. In the 1920s, as a teenager, he was traveling as a sailor, traditional for young men of the country. During this decade he visited Veracruz and other Gulf ports of Mexico various times.\\r\\nHis visits to Mexico impressed him and by the end of the 1930s he decided to immigrate to the country, but World War II delayed his plans. During this war, he became an officer in a cavalry regiment along Sweden\\'s border with Finland, studying Spanish from an old grammar book in his free time.\\r\\nSj�lander became one of many fine artists that immigrated to Mexico in the 20th century. After he left his country at the end of the war, he first went to Cuba, where he stayed for a year.  In 1947, he arrived again to Veracruz. He was attracted to Mexico as a kind of \"tropical paradise\" relatively unaffected by the vices of civilization and also free from the long winters of Sweden. Eager to explore his new home, the traveled the country, to Mexico City, Guadalajara, Tehuantepec, Juchit�n and San Blas for two years, creating more than 200 paintings and many more drawings. He was particularly impressed with the landscapes in Oaxaca, but eventually settled in Mexico City.\\r\\nSj�lander died in Mexico City on March 18, 1988, at the age of 80.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nSj�lander began his artistic career in Sweden. He began creating prints, especially lithography in the mid 1940s, and to survive often had to paint cafes and other commercial establishments. In 1944, he had an individual exhibition at the Olsen Art Gallery, then at the Modern Art Gallery in 1945 and 1946. These exhibitions made him an established artist in his home country.\\r\\nAfter arriving in Mexico, Diego Rivera and Jos� Clemente Orozco helped the artist get his first individual exhibition in Mexico with the then Museo Nacional de Artes Pl�sticas of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1948, followed by another in 1950, where his work received favorable reviews. Other important individual exhibitions include another at the same museum in 1960, the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1965 and 1969, the Sal�n de la Pl�stica Mexicana in 1957, 1958 and 1967, the Mer-Kup Gallery in Mexico City in 1966 and 1968 and the Konstakademie in Sweden in 1961. He also participated in numerous collective exhibitions in Mexico and countries such as Japan, France, Hungary and Cuba. Many of these were biennale events such as the Sal�n Annual de Pintura y Grabado in Mexico City in 1958, the International Biennale of Painting, Sculpture and Engraving in 1960, various biennales of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes for sculpture in the 1960s, the International Printing Biennale in Tokyo in 1960 and 1972 and the Sao Paulo Biennale in 1961 and 1972. In 1982 he was elected to the selection committee for the Triennial of Sculpture.\\r\\nSj�lander\\'s works can be found in the collection of the National Museum of Sweden, the Modern Art Museum of Stockholm, the Tessin Museum in Paris, the Gothenburg Museum, the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the National Museum of Rhodesia and the Casa de las Am�ricas in Cuba.\\r\\nIn addition to producing art for which he never accepted the help of a patron, Sj�lander also taught at the Escuela Nacional de Pintura, Escultura y Grabado \"La Esmeralda\" (1971-1985) and at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl�sticas (1977-1985). In 1985 he joined the Centro de Investigaci�n y Experimentaci�n Pl�stica.\\r\\nSj�lander\\'s  work was recognized with various distinctions during his lifetime, including Knight\\'s Decoration First Class from his home country of Sweden in 1959, membership in the Order of Saint Michael in France in the 1960s along with membership in the Sal�n de la Pl�stica Mexicana. He received the Xipe-Totec award  at the First National Sculpture Biennale in 1962 and the first sculpture prize from the Salon de la Pl�stica Mexicana in 1971. Retrospectives of his work include one at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1985, one from the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1991 and at the Museo Dolores Olmedo in 1998.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtistry\\r\\nSj�lander painted, sculpted and did printmaking during his career, designing over 500 of the tools he used. In painting he worked in oils and in printing he worked in etching, dry point, lithography and monotype. He sculpted three-dimensional works along with reliefs (his specialty) in plaster, bronze and wood, with wood his most expressive medium. He often obtained his materials on his travels in Mexico, such as mahogany from Veracruz.\\r\\nThe artist\\'s work, especially his painting, is noted for its use of color. In Sweden his was a member of a group called the \"Colorists of Gothenburg\" as an art movement in that country, which experimented with colors not before used there. When he arrived to Mexico, nature and the colors common in Mexico were very different from his home country and changes to his art began almost immediately, although in both places nature played a dominant role. His earlier work used bolder colors than later work, which became more subtle and delicate. Fernando Gamboa wrote that \"His autonomy lies in his color, in the rich hues that never shatter the surface of the painting; the balance and originality of his sculptures reveal a unique resolution of form and style.\\r\\nA large number of his paintings, reliefs and engraving relate to man and landscape, with only a few portraits such as one of his wife, Aurora, in 1952. His early work was more figurative, showing influence from Edvard Munch (who he met in Oslo), Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard and northern European Expressionism, due to his formal training. Although he was of the age of the Mexican Muralists, in Mexico he became part of the following Generaci�n de la Ruptura. His work gradually became less figurative. By the end of the 1950s and early 1960s, the human figure began to divide and by the 1970s and early 1980s he work was more of an abstract analysis of form with silhouettes.\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\\r\\nWaldemar Sj�lander in the Ibero-American Institute (Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation) catalogue, Berlin\\r\\nLiterature by and about Waldemar Sj�lander in the German National Library catalogue\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', \"Chen Chung-hsin (Chinese: 陳忠信; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: Tân Tiong-sìn; born 15 April 1949) is a Taiwanese journalist, editor, and politician.\\r\\nChen studied mathematics at Tunghai University and began his career in journalism, serving as a writer for the Independence Daily Post for eight years, as well as editor of Formosa Magazine and Taiwan Social Research Quarterly.

Introduced in 2015, the character was created by Blake Zeff and mostly written by Felix Biederman and Virgil Texas for CAFE, an online publisher of political news and satire, in the run-up to the 2016 United States presidential election.\\r\\nDiggler, a middle-aged, centrist pundit who prides himself on his \"inside the Beltway\" knowledge of the Washington, D.C. political scene, is the purported author of a column published at CAFE and a keen, if clueless, Twitter user. Portrayed as a smug, ignorant blowhard, the character hero-worships the bombast and theatre of American politics with little concern for its consequences. His writing frequently exposes details of his failed marriage and protracted family court proceedings for custody of his son Colby. Texas described the target of the character as \"ridiculous\" pundits. During 2016 Diggler also hosted The DigCast, a podcast featuring weekly guests, with Biederman giving voice to Diggler and Texas playing Diggler\\'s millennial intern. Biederman also established the Chapo Trap House podcast in 2016, which Texas has co-hosted.\\r\\nWriting as Diggler, Biederman and Texas began using their intuition to guess the outcomes of primary contests in the election. By the end of the primary season, Diggler claimed to have correctly predicted more winners than data journalist Nate Silver\\'s FiveThirtyEight blog. However, that comparison may be misleading: depending how predictive success is measured, Diggler either comes out ahead or roughly on par with FiveThirtyEight\\'s model. Texas ran an op-ed in The Washington Post about their predictive success and the ways Diggler exposed the flaws of supposedly objective data-journalistic techniques.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthorship\\r\\nCafe editor-in-chief Blake Zeff came up with the original idea for Carl Diggler, and hired Biederman and Texas to develop the character and write his columns. Biederman was then a freelance writer on various topics, and Texas was a former contributor to The Onion; both were popular Twitter personalities. Zeff contributed ideas, edits the columns, and helped to run Carl Diggler\\'s in-character Twitter account, but the articles and social media posts by the character were largely the work of Biederman and Texas.\\r\\nIn addition to tweeting in-character as Diggler, Biederman and Texas typically wrote one to four Diggler columns a week. Splitsider writer Eddie Brawley said Texas has \"the more polished, literary style\" and a skill for tonal imitation of writers like Hunter S. Thompson when the occasion calls, while Biederman possesses a \"preternatural ability to observe and exploit the tiny absurdities of online behavior.\"\\r\\nBiederman and Texas had semi-fictional counterparts under their own names as Diggler\\'s interns. They occasionally broke the fourth wall in the column to write articles as themselves when they were, in real life, on-location covering political events on the 2016 campaign trail—under the fictional pretext that Diggler, meanwhile, is stuck moping back in his Park Slope apartment.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacter\\r\\nSources and targets of parody\\r\\nDiggler is a satirical parody of the American political pundit class. Diggler has worked in national political journalism for thirty years, starting as chief political editor at the Minnetonka Bugle, and is the author of the book Think-ocracy: The Rise Of The Brainy Congressman. Most Diggler articles begin with a credo reminding readers that Diggler uses \"gut, conventional wisdom and personal experience\" when analyzing politics. Texas offered this summation of Diggler\\'s persona and satiric purpose:\\r\\n\\r\\nCarl exists to satirize all that is vacuous, elitist and ridiculous about the media class. From his sycophantic love of candidates in uniform to his hatred of Bernie Bros, from his reverence for \"the discourse\" to his constant threats of suing the people who troll him on Twitter, Carl is predicated on being myopic, vain and — frankly — wrong.\\r\\nBiederman said Diggler \"grew out of the craven inanity and absurd self-importance you see in the worst \\'wonks\\' and horserace pundits, but we exaggerated it to make him as much of a clown as we personally saw these people.\" Diggler writes with adoration for the ceremonial decorum of American politics, but blithe, often oblivious disregard for the plight faced by real voters.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiggler\\'s persona and political outlook are drawn from specific real-life journalists. In an episode of the podcast Chapo Trap House, Biederman and Texas listed Digger\\'s biggest influences as Chris Cillizza, Mark Halperin, and above all, \"greatest hack of all time\" Ron Fournier. Cillizza wrote for the Washington Post blog The Fix, and his tone and tendency to refer to his wife as Mrs. Fix and his son as Fix Jr. were borrowed for Diggler. From Halperin, author of campaign books Game Change and Double Down: Game Change 2012, Diggler received his desire to ingratiate himself with politicians and to make himself the focus of attention. Fournier, the most significant source for Diggler, covered Bill Clinton\\'s career as governor of Arkansas and worked at the Associated Press D.C. bureau during Clinton\\'s presidency. In Biederman and Texas\\'s view, Fournier gave Diggler journalistic credulousness and centrist belief that both sides of any issue are at fault. Biederman and Texas also cited columnists David Brooks and Richard Cohen for \"bullshitting most of the time\" but with an \"unearned tone of authority.\"\\r\\nDiggler\\'s resemblance to specific journalists has been spotted by other writers: for instance, Silver has been described as \"the natural O\\'Reilly to Diggler\\'s Colbert,\" while Fournier was once called \"the real life Carl Diggler\". When a Niall Ferguson article compared the prospect of Brexit to his divorce, Jeet Heer compared Ferguson\\'s writing to Diggler\\'s \"habit of linking every public event with his failed marriage.\" Because of the continuous, online, interactive, and source material recycling nature of Diggler, the character has been described as a work of metafiction. Through Twitter, Diggler has been mistaken for a real person by journalists and even presidential candidate Jim Webb, who retweeted Diggler\\'s over-the-top, sarcastic endorsement. Journalists who Diggler has duped include Abby Huntsman (then co-host of The Cycle on MSNBC), Jill Filipovic (a writer whose work appears in Cosmopolitan), and even Diggler\\'s chief inspiration Fournier.\\r\\n\\r\\nDiggler\\'s personal life\\r\\nMediaite\\'s Sam Reisman described Diggler\\'s personal life as a \"richly detailed canon\" and a \"batshit American picaresque.\" Diggler is an unhappily divorced father of a \"round son,\" Colby, over whom he is locked in a never-ending custody battle with his ex-wife, only called Ex-Mrs. The Dig. The custody battle has caused Diggler to resent the family court system, and he constantly invokes his concerns about family court in his column and even incorporates them into his political thought in contrived ways. It is also often implied that Diggler is a sex addict, with the character unwittingly making references to his foot fetish and interest in sex tourism and camgirls. In search of love, Diggler briefly dates a feminist NYU student referred to by her Tumblr handle, KweenTrashWytch✨✨ (including the two sparkle emoji). During his period of dating KweenTrashWytch✨✨, Diggler became \"woke\" and, claiming to follow his newfound understanding of intersectional feminism, endorsed Carly Fiorina in an attempt to impress his girlfriend.\\r\\nAfter a bad breakup sparked by KweenTrashWytch✨✨ destroying his posters of Senator Lindsey Graham, Diggler disappeared from the website. He later emerged as the subject of a hostage video, after being captured in Syria by Assad loyalists and then turned over to the Russian government. However, he was able to return to America after the Russians decided he wasn\\'t worth keeping around and put him on a plane to New York.\\r\\nDiggler\\'s life took a turn for the worse when his horribly-mistaken predictions for the 2016 US Presidential Election led to Cafe replacing him with Diggler superfan David \"The Milk\" Milkberg as their \"Chief Politics Writer\" at the site. On top of that, Diggler was evicted from his studio apartment and lost partial custody of Colby. Diggler has partially recovered by writing independent political analysis pieces and posting them on Medium, but his efforts to crowdfund his future journalism work have been hamstrung after he previously used crowdfunding sites to donate to Russian camgirls he met online and accidentally \"donated several thousands of dollars to Hamas.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2016 presidential primary predictions\\r\\nFollowing the practice of many other political journalists and news publications, Diggler published predictions for who would win each contest of the 2016 presidential primary season. Diggler\\'s predictions were actually made by Biederman and Texas, without reliance on data or traditional analysis. Diggler backed up his picks with absurd, often grotesque rationales, based on the character\\'s \"gut\" reading of a state electorate\\'s supposed tendencies and mindsets. Biederman said the predictions were made based on \"personal hate of a candidate, the broad prejudices of their voters, anecdotal experience, and sexual pathology.\" In an in-character interview with Complex, Diggler himself attributed his predictive success to \"two variables: gut and experience.\"\\r\\nIn a surprise to observers, as well as to Biederman and Texas themselves, Diggler\\'s predictions proved to be highly accurate, and even seemed to match or outperform rigorous, statistical predictive models used by other publications. Most conspicuously, Diggler correctly predicted more primary outcomes than the models used by Nate Silver\\'s FiveThirtyEight, a prominent data journalism and statistics blog owned by ESPN.\\r\\nAfter his predicting streak became apparent, Diggler gloated to Silver on Twitter and in his column, even challenging Silver to a head-to-head contest. Cafe launched \"SixThirtyEight,\" a tally of Diggler\\'s predictive wins over FiveThirtyEight. According to the \"SixThirtyEight\" tally, Diggler predicted with 89% accuracy, calling 81 of 91 total contests comprising the primaries for both major parties in every state and United States territory. By contrast, FiveThirtyEight had a 56% success rate in the total 91 contests. FiveThirtyEight had chosen not to make predictions in some contests, all of which Diggler counted as forfeits. The FiveThirtyEight predictive model left contests without a prediction if there was too little data to make a prediction or if the race was too close to call (for example, FiveThirtyEight did not make a prediction in the Alaska primaries), while Diggler made a prediction in every race (including small contests like the Guam primaries). Diggler predicted many more total winners, but if FiveThirtyEight\\'s non-predictions are ignored rather than counted as forfeits, then Diggler and FiveThirtyEight still had a roughly equal rate of success.\\r\\nFollowing the attention given to Diggler\\'s results, Texas wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post explaining the Diggler character, their methodology, and what he believed Diggler\\'s results revealed about the flaws of purportedly objective, detached journalism. In the editorial, Texas said that Silver\\'s predictions were, despite their reliance on data, not falsifiable and thus unscientific, and that they overstated the statistical impact of factors like endorsements based on subjective assumptions about historical elections. Texas wrote that readers of data journalism—such as voters, other journalists, and members of the political establishment—rely on quasi-scientific predictions and analysis when making political decisions, in ways that adversely shapes the real outcomes:\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the quants had not ignored Trump\\'s soaring popularity all last year, perhaps the GOP establishment would not have sat on their hands as he waltzed to the nomination. And if the same pundits had not been writing Sanders\\'s obituary before any votes were cast, perhaps that race would be even closer. Maybe a more subjective form of analysis, such as going out and listening to voters, would have understood their passions better than the data journalists\\' models.\\r\\nIn interviews, Biederman said that they do believe there is a place for data journalism, but that its prominent practitioners had relied on outdated theories of how elections work and failed to account for the unprecedented anger of voters in an ahistorical election.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DigCast\\r\\nDiggler is voiced by Biederman, who increases the pitch of his ordinarily deep voice and adopts an accent similar to The Simpsons character Ned Flanders. Either Biederman and Texas speaking about Diggler, or Biederman playing Diggler, appeared on multiple podcasts prior to getting their own show, including District Sentinel Radio, Reply All, Chapo Trap House, and a live taping of The Katie Halper Show on WBAI. Biederman and Texas launched The DigCast on July 1, 2016, with Biederman voicing Diggler and Texas playing his intern. Guests have included former Gawker editor Alex Pareene, comedian Brandon Wardell, Braddock, Pennsylvania Mayor John Fetterman, writer and MSNBC host Steve Kornacki, and The Intercept editor Glenn Greenwald. Biederman tweeted on February 25, 2017 that The Digcast had ended. Episodes can be streamed from SoundCloud or iTunes.\\r\\n\\r\\nEpisodes\\r\\nReception\\r\\nAccording to Eddie Brawley, Diggler\\'s writing has a niche appeal, because understanding the column\\'s many elaborate in-joke references requires a reader to closely follow media discourse on Twitter and the character\\'s own idiosyncrasies and intricate storylines. Diggler\\'s audience and social media following include many \"hip\" establishment media figures who are \"in on the joke.\" Biederman said he had seen positive feedback to Diggler from people with a wide variety of political identifications.\\r\\nDiggler\\'s primary predictions have generally received a positive response. Corinne Grinapol wrote in the blog FishbowlDC that \"Diggler exists in opposition to objective analysis, but is also a reminder that the idea of objective analysis is an often-impossible ideal disguised as an attainable one. Diggler\\'s biases are not the only ones worth being aware of.\" In National Review, Theodore Kupfer cited Diggler\\'s predictions and Texas\\' op-ed as prescient, in contrast to Silver and other pundits who had been blindsided by the unexpected rise of Donald Trump. However, Washington Post blogger Callum Borchers dismissed the SixThirtyEight project as misleading, believing Biederman and Texas inflated the appearance of Diggler\\'s success, and urged readers to \"not be silly and pretend like [Diggler]\\'s some kind of proof that data journalism and poll-based prognostication is B.S.; he isn\\'t more accurate than Nate Silver.\"\\r\\nIn 2018, Yale University\\'s humor magazine The Yale Record resurrected its \"Humorist of the Year Award\" and gave it to Biederman and Texas, in recognition of their work on Diggler and Chapo Trap House.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nChapo Trap House, a podcast that features Felix Biederman and Virgil Texas as hosts\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nThe DigCast on Google Podcasts\\r\\nThe DigCast on Apple Podcast\\r\\nThe DigCast on SoundCloud\\r\\nCarl Diggler on Twitter\\r\\nCreators Felix Biederman and Virgil Texas on Twitter\\r\\nCarl Diggler\\'s CAFE posts archived on the Internet Archive', 'Thomas Henry Shadwell Clerke, KH (1792–1849), was an Irish soldier and military journalist.\\r\\nClerke was a native of Bandon, Cork.

He was appointed to an ensigncy without purchase in 1808 and as a subaltern in 28th and 5th Foot, he served through the Peninsular campaigns until the loss of his right leg in the combat at Redinha in 1811 incapacitated him for further active service. On the recommendation of Lord Wellington, he was promoted to a company in the 1st Garrison Battalion, with which served until its reduction in 1814.\\r\\nHe afterwards served with the 2nd Battalion, 57th Foot, and on the army depot staff. He was promoted to a majority unattached in 1830. He became the editor of Colburn\\'s United Service Magazine when that journal was started in January 1829, and so continued until July 1842. On the death of Colonel Gurwood, he was entrusted with the task of seeing the last volume of Selections from the Wellington Despatches through the press. He possessed a familiar acquaintance with the French, Italian, and Spanish languages, and, although his name does not appear as the author of any scientific or other works, was a very active member of the British Association and of various learned societies.

Covertly, Chamorro attended small-arms training, studied Marxism and joined the propaganda section of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN),. becoming chief of the Agitation and Propaganda Department.\\r\\nHis father was assassinated the following year, prompting Chamorro to turn to journalism, becoming a reporter at his father\\'s former paper La Prensa. Following the fall of the Somoza regime, Chamorro\\'s mother briefly joined the Sandinista junta, but became disenchanted in less than a year and, with Chamorro\\'s siblings Pedro Joaquín and Cristiana, returned to La Prensa, which she turned into an opposition paper again, but this time opposing the FSLN. This prompted a number of departures from the paper, including Chamorro who became editor in chief of Barricada, the FSLN\\'s newspaper, which had taken over the physical plant of the Somozas regime\\'s paper, Novedades. (Meanwhile his uncle Xavier Chamorro sold his shares of La Prensa to found El Nuevo Diario, which was sympathetic to the FSLN, and Chamorro\\'s sister Claudia joined the FSLN government as ambassador to Costa Rica, while Chamorro\\'s brother Pedro Joaquín left Nicaragua to join the Contras.)\\r\\nIn 1984, Chamorro was in charge of publicity for Daniel Ortega\\'s campaign for President.\\r\\nIn 1990, Chamorro\\'s mother was elected President of Nicaragua, defeating FSLN\\'s Daniel Ortega. Chamorro had opposed his mother\\'s candidacy, feeling it was counter-revolutionary and a sign of the weakness of the conservative party that nominated her. After she won, he remained at Barricada though it was no longer the government newspaper. It continued to be strongly sympathetic to the FSLN and critical of the new government, but also developed new editorial independence: expanding beyond a strictly political project allowed for new reporting projects. This departure from strictly promotional material to including investigations that sometimes embarrassed the FSLN drew ire from some orthodox members and, following the party congress in 1994, the FSLN took back control of the paper. Chamorro and other top editors were fired.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndependent journalism\\r\\nIn June 1995 Chamorro began the weekly television newsmagazine \"Esta Semana\" and Cinco, and in 1996, he founded the news website Confidencial. Chamorro was a Knight Fellow at Stanford University in 1997–1998. He spent the following year at University of California, Berkeley, teaching reporting on Central America and taking classes, as well as learning from US newsmedia like 60 Minutes and NPR.\\r\\nIn 2005 Chamorro began his daily news show, Esta Noche.\\r\\nHe won the 2010 Maria Moors Cabot Prize from Columbia University.\\r\\nIn January 2019, Chamorro went into exile in Costa Rica, after the police raid of Confidencial\\'s offices on 14 December 2018, the same day they searched offices of a number of non-governmental organizations that alleged human rights violations by the government. Chamorro returned in late November of the same year.\\r\\nChamorro went into exile again in June 2021 after his siblings were arrested by the Nicaraguan authorities. He was also charged with various financial crimes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonors\\r\\nIn 2010, Chamorro won a Maria Moors Cabot Prize, administered by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. The award citation said Chamorro \"serves as an outstanding example of courage in standing up to abuse by an authoritarian regime.\"\\r\\nIn 2021, Chamorro won a Ortega y Gasset Award for lifetime achievement in Spanish-language journalism, awarded by El País. The jury for the prize commended him as \"an emblem of the defense of freedom of expression.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal life\\r\\nChamorro is married and has three children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'Carlos Francisco Chang Marín or Changmarín (February 26, 1922 – December 5, 2012) was a Panamanian folklorist, painter, musician, journalist, activist and writer of poetry, essays and children\\'s literature.\\r\\nHis writing, which has been described as close to the people\\'s voice, portrays the class struggle and the search for social justice of his countrymen and working class people of the world. His work usually mixes descriptions of the Ibero-American countryside and simple life beauty with naive humour and optimism with proletarian revolution conclusions and tone. This makes his work very popular among the intellectual middle classes and the working classes, specifically the campesinos (countryside people), who identify themselves with Changmarín\\'s personality and language. Changmarín was himself born and raised in the countryside of Panama.\\r\\nPolitically persecuted in the past, Changmarín\\'s contributions to Panamanian culture and folklore added to his internationally recognized talent and forced otherwise antagonistic institutions such as the government to recognize his achievements. He has won several national awards (see Awards below).\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nChangmarín was the artistic name used by Carlos Francisco Chang Marín, which comes from merging both of his surnames (from his paternal surname \"Chang\" and maternal surname \"Marin\"). It expresses his mixed (Chinese and Creole) heritage.\\r\\nChangmarín was born in Los Leones, Santiago de Veraguas, Panama, being the second son of an out-of-wedlock union between Carlos Chang, a rich, Chinese-Panamanian merchant, and Faustina Marin, a campesina. He grew up among his mother\\'s family, being unable to be acknowledged in public by his father under the conservative values of Panama\\'s countryside of the early 1920s. However, later his father decided to take him from his mother when he was still a child and sent him to live with a paternal aunt. His aunt was brutally abusive, treating him basically as a slave, constantly humiliating his mixed heritage and his mother\\'s social status. The father, although not participating in the abuse, provided no protection from it and even promoted this behavior in some cases.\\r\\nIt is not known when Changmarín left his aunt\\'s house, but he went to Panama City, where he did a series of odd jobs. One of these jobs included working at the Panama Canal under the supervision of U.S. managers, where he witnessed the unfair and abusive conditions between the U.S. personnel and the non-U.S. workers. This added to similar experiences he had had while living with his aunt, who belonged to the richer sector of her hometown. He became determined to establish his proletarian struggle visions and political activism.\\r\\nChangmarín returned to formal education at the Juan Demostenes Arosemena Normal School (founded in 1938). He was mentored by intellectuals from South America and Europe, most of whom were victims of European fascism, which helped to consecrate and refine his ideals. He also undertook brief studies in the Panama National Conservatory of Music, which he did not complete.\\r\\nBetween 1940 and 1950, Changmarín worked as a teacher in several provinces, where he organized the student movement in strikes to denounce key issues regarding the country\\'s social problems. This resulted in his being fired from his post.\\r\\nDuring this period, he was incarcerated several times, but this did not stop him from working in several jobs while in prison. He estimates that he spent some four years of his life behind bars. After being in and out of prison under political charges, Changmarín was finally exiled to Chile in 1968. While living there, he studied painting at the Universidad National de Chile and became very active in the Salvador Allende presidential campaign.\\r\\nOnce he was allowed to return to Panama, Changmarín established himself in several leadership and organizational roles within the Communist movement. He continuously worked in his artistic endeavours to deliver social and cultural messages. During this period resulted he was nationally recognized as one of the persons responsible for the Panama Canal struggle against the United States.  This struggle ended with the United States returning the operational control of the Canal Zone, which used to be forbidden for Panamanians.\\r\\nUntil his death from stomach cancer, Changmarín lived in his birth town of Santiago de Veraguas with his companion Eneida Romero.  He continued to write, paint and participate in political and ecological commentary and activism. The couple had five children, with four of these still living. In addition, it is well known that Changmarín had a passion for nature in general, with a predilection for orchids.\\r\\n\\r\\nWritings\\r\\nAs one of the main Panamanian writers, his work in literature is prolific. During his career, Changmarín has touched on different genres and styles.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoetry\\r\\nChangmarín started writing poetry by the time he was in high school(Juan Demóstenes Arosemena Normal School), mentored at that early period of his artistic life by South American and European teachers, the latter mainly being expatriated victims of the fascist Spanish Franquism. While still in college, he received an honored mention for his participation in the 1942 Ricardo Miró National Awards with a submission of a book containing poetry entitled Punto e\\' llanto.\\r\\nAt this stage, his work was considered to be part of the Ibero-American\\'s post-vanguardists Second World War authors according to several scholars. Being under the vanguardist influence, his poetry developed a tone of despair with a very obvious revolutionary intent.\\r\\nDimas L. Pitty, in his book Letra Viva, describes Changmarín\\'s work as a creation where \"the art is not the reality, but reality\\'s reflection as an artistic image, marked with the author\\'s subjectivism and ideological views; it is also his fiction\".\\r\\nAs a writer, poetry is basically Changmarín\\'s fundamental tool of expression. Once established as a consecrated poet, he reached an outstanding moment in his creation with the book of poetry entitled Poemas Corporales (Corporeal Poems), which was awarded the Ricardo Miró National Award in 1955. With this work, Changmarín showed himself as a developed poet who has achieved great control over this literary form. Changmarín leaves out as much as possible, which mirrors the trends of the time. This clarity serves as a method to deliver the social and political messages, as most of his works are fundamental. His mastery of the decasyllable writing imprints Poemas Corporales with a classical accent comparable to the Quevedo Verses.\\r\\n\\r\\nShort stories\\r\\nChangmarín\\'s short story collections are quite numerous and touch upon several themes and scopes. He tries to recreate the countryside storytelling and atmosphere to expose the problems concerning land ownership and exploitation suffered by the countryside people. The latifundia is still very common in Ibero-America. It is endorsed by the government, religious as well as right-wing policy-makers (who generally represent the rich sectors of the society) and transnational corporations.\\r\\nAs are most of his works, the short stories are highly political in nature, describing and portraying historical events, as seen in his compendium Noche Buena Mala. Here, stories are related to the events of the 1989 U.S. Military invasion of Panama in (December 20, 1989).\\r\\nWhen not being used as a way to deliver and expose political, historical and eco-humanistic paradigms, his short stories have been described to be highly emotional and profoundly radical in form. An example of this is his work Seis Madres, possibly being the most researched and analyzed of his works in this genre. It has been described as written by bursts of raw emotions; an anti-story, and as the first Panamanian short story that could be used to formulate a theory regarding the creative writing process.\\r\\n\\r\\nNovels\\r\\nChangmarín has published three novels. He mainly writes in a historical narrative style which has been praised by critics for its attention to detail in the description of the physical frame (flora, fauna, geography) as well as the cultural frame. Changmarín alluded to Victoriano Lorenzo in almost all his larger works for adults and children in an effort to place him as a founding father of Panama. To Chang Marín, Lorenzo was the first true Panamanian whose life story and identity parallel that of Panama as a nation.\\r\\nHis latest novel, targeted mainly to young readers, Las Gracias y las Desgracias de Chico Perico (2005), had a more autobiographical approach.\\r\\n\\r\\nChildren\\'s literature\\r\\nHaving published several books dedicated to reach the youth, Changmarín tries to deliver his social messages in order to promote human sensibilities and awareness to all ages. Through children\\'s literature, he takes advantage of his pedagology formation by using a profound knowledge of the popular and simple art and language.\\r\\nUsing attractive illustrations (hand-drawn by himself) and a short-chapter format to ease the interest of young readers, Changmarín has published in several fields, from poetry to history books. Many scholars consider his children\\'s literature works an expression of his tender side without losing his message and they place many of his works in this area as jewels of Panamanian literature.\\r\\nPart of his creation in this field is inspired by his own experiences as a child and by the constant interaction with his own grand and great-grandchildren, to whom most of these books have been dedicated.\\r\\nHighly recognized in this area are his poems Las Tonadas y los Cuentos de la Cigarra (1975) and La Muñeca de Tusa (2001) and the novels El Cholito Que Llegó a General (1978) and Las Gracias y las Desgracias de Chico Perico (2005).\\r\\n\\r\\nEssays\\r\\nChangmarín\\'s works in the field of essays concentrate on the folkloric, artistic, historical and political areas. Many of his essays have been published in international magazines and newspapers.\\r\\nMost of his political essays deal with the relations between the United States of America\\'s policies toward the Panama Canal and Panama in general, as well as its economic models and the impact these have in the region.\\r\\nAs a strong proponent of socialism, Changmarín\\'s conclusions portray a critical view to the current international policies of the United States and other pro-globalization countries and organizations such as World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund and World Bank.\\r\\n\\r\\nJournalism\\r\\nAs a journalist, Changmarín has a long history contributing with commentaries and opinions appearing in several Panamanian and international newspapers, especially the Cuban newspaper Granma. He is highlighted among several others (Milciades Amores C, Mario Riera Pinilla, Alejandro Chock Valdés, Gonzalo Castro, René González and Eustolio Darío Him) as a pioneer of the Prensa Chica (\"small press\") movement in Panama, with his participation in El Cholo newspaper.\\r\\nFor several years, he had his own newspaper column, Las Famosas Cartas a Tula (The famous letters to my Aunt Tula), in one of the most widely circulated newspapers, La Critica.  His column was popular due to his humorous approach to contemporary problems.\\r\\nParallel to his contributions to the mainstream media, Changmarín founded and directed the weekly bulletin Unidad, an information bulletin publication for the Panamanian Communist Party.\\r\\n\\r\\nMusic\\r\\nIn the field of music, Changmarín has produced a long list of compositions, both in writing lyrics and creating the musical arrangements. One of his best-known creations comprise the lyrics for Tio Caiman, made famous by the Chilean group Quilapayún. The piece has also been recorded in Colombia, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Panama by several music groups. The piece is sometimes sung by spectators in soccer matches and performed at music concerts across Ibero-America. Changmarín is hardly known as the creator, but this is a credit that he does not pursue. The Panamanian Birthday Song, recorded by the DEXA orchestra directed by Edgardo Quintero, is also one of his creations and is considered to be a unique contribution to the Panamanian culture and identity.\\r\\nAnother of his records is Alma Panameña, which was produced as part of the cultural development programs of the European Union and PROAPEMEP.\\r\\n\\r\\nDécima\\r\\nChangmarín is a broadly recognized décima composer in Panama. His interest in this field is related to his folklore research and he has been promoting the recognition of this form of expression of the countryside people for more than half a century. As the main coordinator for the Veraguas delegations in the Mejorana National Festival (since 1950), he has become a one-man cultural institution in this art form.\\r\\nChangmarín is the only Panamanian décima composer who published three books dealing with décima composition as well as décimas compilations. The books Socabón, Décimas Populares para Cantar (1959), Los Versos del Pueblo (1973) and  Cantadera, 130 Décimas para Cantar (1995) have been used as references and inspiration to generations of décimas performers.\\r\\n\\r\\nActivism\\r\\nPolitical\\r\\nChangmarín\\'s political activism reached an important moment in his life with the foundation of the Panamanian Communist Party (Partido del Pueblo) in 1950. Since communism was outlawed at that time by Panamanian law, this initiative was forced to be conducted secretly. The Panamanian government reacted to the growing dissent and communist organization in the countryside by increasing repression, reaching the extremes of perpetrating political assassinations and disappearances.\\r\\nChangmarín used his writings as his main weapon for resistance. For years, he used politically charged décimas as means to educate the people about identity and the struggle at hand. Que se vayan del Canal (I wish they would just leave from the Canal) and Quiero Sembrar un Maíz (I want to plant corn in the Canal Zone) were the songs of the protests against the constant abuse by the United States.\\r\\nHis clear and direct writing form serves as a tool for the constant struggles and protests that were taking place in Ibero-America during the 1970s and 1980s. The décima, having a bard-like effect as an artistic expression and Changmarín having mastered the form, managed to merge it with the social angst-ridden echoes of the dispossessed and the nationalist feelings of the people to \"incense a protest in each fist and a march in each step\".\\r\\n\\r\\nEcological\\r\\nChangmarín was a strong proponent of an environmental-friendly way of life and critic of the consumer-oriented free market and industrialization. Having a strong emotional connection with the countryside environment, he actively participates in radio shows commentaries about the topic.\\r\\nMoreover, he expressed an integrated relationship between culture and nature, rejecting the industrial Western concept of progress, instead promoting the philosophy of simple life. Although he never openly endorsed Anarcho-Primitivism, there are clear correlations between his views and the movement.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nPoetry\\r\\nRomance de la Niña Perdida\\r\\nPunto ‘e llanto (1942)\\r\\nPoemas Corporales (1956)\\r\\nSocabón.

One of the first native Cuban sculptors, Villalta was a mulatto born in Havana. Thanks to private patrons, he was able to train in Europe, first in Canarias (Spain) and then in la Reale Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara. He worked in Italy and Cienfuegos.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nVillalta created several important Cuban monuments and statues, including the statue of Jos� Marti located in Havana\\'s Parque Central (Central Park) (dedicated February 24, 1905) and the monument to Cuban engineer Francisco de Albear. Villalta completed the Albear statue in Florence, Italy in 1893. The sculptor won a national competition to create a memorial to eight Cuban medical students executed in 1871 by Spanish colonial troops. It was completed in 1889, and it was the first monument made in Cuba by a Cuban artist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Havana\\'s Necropolis Cristobal Colon (Christopher Columbus Cemetery), Villalta made the sculptures of the  Virtues (Faith, Hope and Charity) above the main cemetery entrance and the religious relief sculptures around the cemetery walls. Villalta also created the monument at the most visited place in Necropolis Colon, the grave of Amelia Goyri de la Hoz [de Adot], a woman known as \"La Milagrosa\" (\"The Miraculous Woman\" or \"The Miraculous One\"). An upper-class woman, she died in childbirth in 1901 at age 23, and her stillborn son was placed at her feet when she was buried. According to legend, when the grave was opened years later, her corpse was intact � a sign of holiness � and her son was nestled in her arms. Amelia is considered by many to be Cuba\\'s unofficial saint. Cubans come to her grave every day to ask for children or love affairs. Villalta carved the sculpture out of one piece of Carrara marble, and he finished the work in 1902.\\r\\nIn his last years, he made the marble monument of Joaqu�n Albarr�n, in Sagua La Grande, in 1910 and the monument dedicated to the martyrs, located in the Martyrs Park, in the city of C�rdenas, Matanzas Province, Cuba. The last one was placed in 1912, shortly after Villalta\\'s death.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n\\r\\nVeigas Zamora, Jos� (2005). Escultura en Cuba: Siglo XX.

He is a descendant of Portuguese nobleman Luis de Alpoim.\\r\\nGuedes spent much of his life in Portuguese Mozambique from the age of 7 years old and he would stay there for most of his life.\\r\\nWanting to become an artist, he enrolled at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg in 1945. He soon decided to study architecture which was to him the culmination and combination of all the artistic trades that interested him.\\r\\n\\r\\nArchitecture career\\r\\nGuedes then began his career and produced a multitude of projects in the 1950s and 60s as building activity intensified in Mozambique.\\r\\nIn East Africa he produced the designs for hundreds of buildings, many of them in the city of Lourenço Marques (Maputo) but also in Angola, in South Africa, and in Portugal. His creations mixed the sculptural and figurative with practical requirements and traditional local identity.\\r\\nGuedes was part of  “Team 10”, a group of architects who assembled in July 1953 at the 9th Congress of CIAM and adopted a new approach to urbanism through impactful theoretical frameworks which influenced the development of European architectural thought during the late 20th century.\\r\\nArguably, one of Guedes\\' most famous buildings is the Smiling Lion Building from 1956 built in Mozambique. Guedes calls the style of this building STILOGUEDES which translates loosely as \\'GuedesStyle\\'. The high level mural on the West façade is still intact and so is the \"smiling lion\" on the North corner. The lion is a small concrete casting with a smile hence the name of the building.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtistic career\\r\\nAside from his large-scale architectural projects, he was also a sculptor and painter.\\r\\nExhibitions of his visual art have taken place at the Berardo Collection Museum in Lisbon, among other venues.\\r\\nGuedes bought works by Paul Klee in 1948, admiring his surrealist style and infantile themes. He made sculptures inspired by Paul Klee\\'s Angels at the end of his career. One of his last sketches, made in 2015, was entitled \\'A Tribute to Paul Klee\\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical problems\\r\\nAfter the events of the Carnation Revolution in Lisbon, he left newly independent Mozambique in 1974. Mozambique was officially established in 1975 as the People\\'s Republic of Mozambique.\\r\\nHis rapid departure from Mozambique in 1974 along with other Portuguese subject to the 24/20 declaration (giving them 24 hours to leave and allowing them to take 20 kilograms of belongings) left his family almost penniless. Due to his reputation, he received an invitation to take the vacant chair of Architecture at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath\\r\\nPancho Guedes died on 7 November 2015 at the age of 90.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nChurch in Maputo (1962)\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\\r\\nOfficial site', 'Orlando Mart�nez Howley (September 23, 1944 � March 17, 1975) was a left-wing journalist and member of the Communist Party of the Dominican Republic who was a critic of President Joaqu�n Balaguer. He was ordered to be killed by the then president in 1975, and in 2000, four men were given 30-year jail sentences in connection with the killing. Orlando Mart�nez has become a symbol of freedom of expression in the Dominican Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonal\\r\\nOrlando Mart�nez was born in Las Matas de Farf�n in the Dominican Republic, in 1944. His father Luis Mariano Martinez and mother Adriana Howley had five boys, including Orlando, and his brothers were B�lgica, T�cides (deceased), Nelson, and Sergio. He was educated at the Universidad Aut�noma de Santo Domingo, which was close to where he was killed. His mother persisted in pushing for the reopening of her son\\'s case after his assassination.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nOrlando Mart�nez was the editor of Revista Ahora and a columnist for the daily paper El Nacional. His column, \"Microscope,\" in the paper was one of the most widely read items of the period because it consistently brought to light crimes and corruption within the ruling Balaguer regime and the military. One of the last articles he wrote defended the rights of the artist Silvano Lora (1934-2003).\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath\\r\\nOrlando Mart�nez had written articles critical of the president. He was assassinated in Santo Domingo de Guzm�n on 17 March 1975 while President Joaqu�n Balaguer was in office.  He was shot on the street called Jos� Contreras near the Universidad Aut�noma de Santo Domingo. The murder weapon was a .38-caliber revolver that was identified as belonging to Mariano Cabrera Duran, who was later extradited from the United States to the Dominican Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nInvestigation\\r\\nFormer President Joaquin Balaguer always claimed to have known who carried out the killing of Orlando Mart�nez but refused to tell the judicial authorities. He opted to not tell who they were and just wrote a \"blank page\" in his autobiography, Memories of a Courtesan in the Era of Trujillo, supposedly leaving for posterity the knowledge of who the killers were.\\r\\nDespite some initial arrests and a reward for information offered by Balaguer the case remained in limbo until President Leonel Fernandez, elected in 1996, ordered the case reopened. In 1998, Mariano Cabrera Duran, owner of a small Bronx Liquor store, was arrested by federal marshals and returned to the Dominican Republic. Duran was connected to the murder weapon that was used to kill Mart�nez.\\r\\nThe orders for the assassination came from Gen. Isidoro Mart�nez, who died of cancer in 2001. Those tried and convicted for carrying out the killing were retired Gen. Antonio Pou Castro, ex-Sergeant Mariano Duran and the two paramilitaries, Rafael Lluberes Ricart and Luis Emilio De la Rosa Veras. In 2000, the four men were given 30-year jail sentences in connection with the killing and Rafael Lluberes Ricart had been identified as the one who shot Mart�nez. The convicted had all been identified in 1975 in connection with the assassination.\\r\\n\\r\\nContext\\r\\nOrlando Mart�nez\\'s assassination was not the only murder case due to political affiliation during the Balaguer 12-year regime. The journalist Jos� Enrique Piera Puig was killed five years before Mart�nez was murdered. The murders of Am�n Abel Hasb�n, leftist-leader Otto Morales, and Maximiliano Gomez were all cases that occurred during this time. Throughout Balaguer\\'s rule, it is estimated that he ordered the murders of more than 2,000 workers, students, and intellectuals combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact\\r\\nThirty years after Orlando Mart�nez\\'s death, journalists from the Dominican Republic continue to write about him. He was known for his strong stances against the ruling regime and after his murder, he became a symbol of freedom of expression in the Dominican Republic.\\r\\n\\r\\nReactions\\r\\nPresident Leonel Fernandez reopened the case in 1996 after he was elected. After the sentence was handed down by the judge, Fernandez said, \"The imposition of sanctions against those that justice has found guilty is still not sufficient to make up for the pain caused by an act of this magnitude.\"\\r\\nThe Inter American Press Association (SIP) followed the Mart�nez through until its resolution.\\r\\n\\r\\nMemorials\\r\\nHis home is now a public memorial.

In 1858, he was accepted for the sculpture workshop at the Escuela de Bellas Artes, where his instructor was the French-born sculptor, Auguste François (1800-1876). \\r\\nIn 1867, thanks to a recommendation from Professor Diego Barros Arana, he was granted a scholarship by President José Joaquín Pérez, which enabled him to continue his studies in Europe. When he arrived in Paris, he was able to join the medallion workshop of the sculptor, Jean-Baptiste Farochon. Two years later, he entered the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts, where he studied with Auguste Dumont and Eugène Guillaume. \\r\\nDue to the Franco-Prussian War, he had to leave Paris; travelling to Belgium, England and Italy. While in Italy, he took time to study; notably with Giuseppe Mancinelli, a friend of the former Director of the Academia de Pintura in Santiago, Alejandro Ciccarelli. Once the situation in France had returned to normal, he went back to Paris and resumed his studies. He returned to Chile in 1876; bringing with him over forty works, including small sculptures, bas-reliefs and medallions. \\r\\nThis direct contact with European art was the decisive factor in creating his artistic personality. He made considerable effort to collect photographs and reproductions for his studio; as graphic documentation. His students were charged with visiting as many museums as possible and making note of what they saw there.\\r\\nHe also experienced intellectual stimulation, which resulted in work as a writer and chronicler; all devoted to the dissemination of art. His many journalistic collaborations included work with  Las veladas literarias (Literary Evenings) and El Ferrocarril (The Railroad). Later, he helped to create the art journals, El San Lunes (On Monday) and El Taller Ilustrado (The Illustrated Workshop, 1885). The latter was Chile's first publication devoted entirely to art.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n Media related to José Miguel Blanco at Wikimedia Commons\\r\\n\\r\\nJosé Miguel Blanco @ Memoria Chilena\", 'Roberto Sebastián Antonio Matta Echaurren (Spanish: [roˈβeɾto ˈmata]; November 11, 1911 – November 23, 2002), better known as Roberto Matta, was one of Chile\\'s best-known painters and a seminal figure in 20th century abstract expressionist and surrealist art across the Americas and Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nMatta was of Spanish, Basque and French descent. Born in Santiago, he studied architecture and interior design at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile in Santiago, and graduated in 1935. That spring, he journeyed from Peru to Panama and completed surreal drawings of many of the geographical features he witnessed. He first encountered Europe while serving in the Merchant Marine after graduating. His travels in Europe and the USA led him to meet artists such as Arshile Gorky, René Magritte, Salvador Dalí, André Breton, and Le Corbusier.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was Breton who provided the major spur to the Chilean\\'s direction in art, encouraging his work and introducing him to the leading members of the Paris Surrealist movement. Matta produced illustrations and articles for Surrealist journals such as Minotaure. During this period he was introduced to the work of many prominent contemporary European artists, such as Pablo Picasso and Marcel Duchamp.\\r\\nThe first true flowering of Matta\\'s own art came in 1938, when he moved from drawing to the oil painting for which he is best known. This period coincided with his emigration to the United States, where he lived until 1948. His early paintings, such as Invasion of the Night, give an indication of the work he would continue, with diffuse light patterns and bold lines on a featureless background. This is also the period of the \"inscape\" series, and the closely related \"psychological morphologies\". Prof. Claude Cernuschi (see Boston College Matta exhibition external link below) writes, \"Matta\\'s key ambition to represent and evoke the human psyche in visual form was filtered through the writings of Freud and the psychoanalytic view of the mind as a three-dimensional space: the \\'inscape\\'.\" According to the essay on Matta in Crosscurrents of Modernism (see references below), the inscapes\\' evocative forms \"are visual analogies for the artist\\'s psyche\" (p. 241). During the 1940s and 1950s, the disturbing state of world politics found reflection in Matta\\'s work, with the canvases becoming busy with images of electrical machinery and distressed figures. The addition of clay to Matta\\'s paintings in the early 1960s lent an added dimension to the distortions.\\r\\nIn his art Matta creates new dimensions in a blend of organic and cosmic lifeforms (see biomorphism). He was one of the first artists to take this abstract leap.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatta\\'s connections with Breton\\'s surrealist movement were severed following a private disagreement concerning Arshile Gorky and his family. Matta was accused of indirectly causing Gorky\\'s suicide (in response to Matta\\'s relationship with the Armenian-American painter\\'s wife). This led to his expulsion from the group, but by this time Matta\\'s own name was becoming widely known. He divided his life between Europe and South America during the 1950s and 1960s, successfully combining the political and the semi-abstract in epic surreal canvases. Matta believed that art and poetry can change lives, and was very involved in the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. He was a strong supporter of the socialist government of president Salvador Allende in Chile.  A 4x24 meter mural of his entitled The First Goal of the Chilean People, was painted over with 16 coats of paint by the military regime of Augusto Pinochet following their violent overthrow of Salvador Allende in 1973.  In 2005 the mural was discovered by local officials. In 2008 the mural was completely restored at a cost of $43,000, and it is displayed today in Santiago at the La Granja city hall.\\r\\nThroughout his life, Matta worked with many different types of media, including ceramic, photography, and video production.\\r\\nMatta died in Civitavecchia, Italy on 23 November 2002, eleven days after his 91st birthday.\\r\\nMatta was married twice: his first wife was Patricia Matta Echaurren (née O\\'Connell), an American (who later married Pierre Matisse), and his second wife was Germana Ferrari. He is the father of six children. Two died prematurely, leaving his creative legacy to artists Gordon Matta-Clark and his twin brother Sebastian, Ramuntcho Matta, Federica Matta, designer Alisée and artist and writer Pablo Echaurren, whose surname was wrongly recorded at birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions (selection)\\r\\nGroup shows\\r\\nIn 2019, his work was included in the group show The Gift of Art, at Pérez Art Museum Miami. The exhibition highlighted important artworks within PAMM\\'s permanent collection on Latinx and Latin American artists.

They are all fictional characters that have appeared in more than one novel in the series. A number of the characters appeared in the television adaptations made for ITV.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice\\r\\nDetective Inspector John Rebus\\r\\nDetective Inspector John Rebus is the protagonist in the Inspector Rebus series. He was born in 1947 in Fife and left school at the age of fifteen to join the Army. After serving in Northern Ireland he applied to undergo selection for the SAS, but after a horrendous ordeal in training, left the army and joined the Lothian and Borders Police.\\r\\nHe is initially introduced as a Detective Sergeant, and is promoted to Detective Inspector early in the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Siobhan Clarke (\"Shiv\") is Rebus\\'s trusted friend and partner. Her given name is represented in IPA /ʃɨˈvɔːn/. In the television dramatisations, Clarke was first played by Gayanne Potter, and then by Claire Price. In the 2024 reboot she is played by Lucie Shorthouse. \\r\\nClarke is much younger than Rebus. Her parents are English and politically active on the left. She has a university degree.  She is a devoted follower of Hibernian Football Club (Hibs). As a woman, she faces obstacles to acceptance in the police force, especially since, like Rebus, she enjoys the challenges of solving cases rather than administrative work or networking.\\r\\nThe relationship between Clarke and Rebus is emotional; she is his apprentice but also something of a daughter figure, and there is, during the middle years, some romantic charge in the relationship as well. She first appears in The Black Book (1993) as a newly promoted Detective Constable. She remains a useful sidekick of Rebus until Set in Darkness (2000), when she becomes a secondary protagonist with chapters devoted to her cases and perspective. She is promoted to Detective Sergeant by the beginning of Resurrection Men (2002) and to Detective Inspector after Exit Music (2007).  As a DI in the later novels, after Rebus\\'s first retirement, she provides him with access to cases, and eventually she, Rebus, and Malcolm Fox become a kind of team. In Saints of the Shadow Bible (2013), Rebus rejoins the police as a DS and she is his superior. In A Song for the Dark Times (2020) she is the one who helps Rebus move downstairs to his new ground floor flat.\\r\\nShe is more willing and able than Rebus to incorporate technology into her work, and in The Falls (2001) she pursues a killer through an email correspondence while Rebus explores historical parallels. She is also more cautious than he about violating policies and procedures, and provides a voice of reason.\\r\\nLike Rebus, she is \"married to the job.\" Most of the men romantically interested in her (or she in them) are policemen. At one point, in Resurrection Men, she has three suitors but prefers the one who is willing to settle for a platonic relationship; later, she and Malcolm Fox have a similarly platonic relationship. In the later books she has an affair with divorced colleague DCI Graham Sutherland.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Chief Superintendent Gill Templer\\r\\nDetective Chief Superintendent Gill Templer is a regular character in Rebus series up through A Question of Blood (2003). She first appears in Knots and Crosses as a Detective Inspector and Press Liaison; she and Rebus have an affair. In the two subsequent novels, he is still in love with her but their relationship is on-and-off-again; it ends definitively when he chooses to move in with Patience Aitkin in Strip Jack (1992). Templer is ambitious and networks with other women who are pushing the boundaries in their professions. She is promoted to Detective Chief Inspector in Let it Bleed and thus becomes Rebus\\'s boss at St. Leonard\\'s police station. She becomes the first female Detective Chief Superintendent just before The Falls. In that novel, she tries to mentor DC Siobhan Clarke. She also plays Cupid to Rebus and Jean Burchill.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssistant Chief Constable Colin Carswell\\r\\nAssistant Chief Constable Colin Carswell is the chief officer with overall responsibility for crime in Lothian and Borders Police. He first appears as Detective Chief Constable Colin Carswell, nicknamed \"The CC Rider,\" in Black and Blue (1997). He reappears as ACC Colin Carswell in Dead Souls (1999), but his description has changed. He continues in that role through The Falls (2001). He and Rebus disapprove of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Chief Superintendent Thomas \"Farmer\" Watson\\r\\nDetective Chief Superintendent Thomas Watson, nicknamed \"The Farmer\" is a senior detective, Rebus\\'s superior, from Hide and Seek (1991) until the first chapter of The Falls (2001), where he retires. He also appears in some of the short stories in A Good Hanging. In most of these novels, he is charge of the CID based at St Leonard\\'s, Edinburgh police station. Occasionally we get a brief glimpse of his point of view on Rebus. Although he is exasperated by Rebus\\'s tendency to ignore his requests and even orders, he appreciates that Rebus gets results.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Chief Inspector Bill Pryde\\r\\nDetective Chief Inspector Bill Pryde is the Chief Inspector at St Leonard\\'s CID before its closure. He is introduced as a Detective Inspector and is promoted prior to Resurrection Men.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Chief Inspector James Macrae\\r\\nDetective Chief Inspector James Macrae is the head of CID at Gayfield Square police station in Edinburgh when Rebus and Clarke are stationed there after the closure of St Leonard\\'s, that is, in Fleshmarket Close, The Naming of the Dead, and Exit Music (2004-2007). He does not like or trust Rebus, not even giving him a desk in the CID room at first, and suspending him three days before retirement in Exit Music. He has a favored DI, Derek Starr, who does what he wants, but he also likes DS Clarke.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Chief Inspector James Page\\r\\nDetective Chief Inspector James Page is in charge of the Gayfield Square CID during the period of Rebus\\'s retirement (starting with Standing in Another Man\\'s Grave, 2012). Because the station was not designed with an office for the DCI, he has repurposed a closet as his office. At first, he and DI Siobhan Clarke seem to have some romantic history, but it is not mentioned in later novels. He is a well-organized, cheerful manager of the team, and loves the limelight and networking with his superiors, which disgusts Rebus. When Rebus serves as a DS at Gayfield Square in Saints of the Shadow Bible, DCI Page does not appreciate him and kicks him out of the station.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Chief Inspector Graham Sutherland\\r\\nDCI Graham Sutherland first appears in In a House of Lies in charge of the Major Incident Team; he includes DI Siobhan Clarke in his group. He is \"early fifties maybe,\" lives in Glasgow, but has been stationed in various locations around the country. By the end of that book, the two are clearly good friends, and by the next book, A Song for the Dark Times, they are lovers; she recalls that he has asked her to move in with him, but she is doubtful. He is divorced but signs of his ex-wife linger at his home, and she doubts he has bothered to buy a new bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief Inspector Lauderdale\\r\\nChief Inspector Frank Lauderdale (\"Fart\" Lauderdale) is described as Rebus\\'s senior officer so presumably a Detective Chief Inspector, and as a \"bigot.\" He appears in the novels from Strip Jack (1992) to Let it Bleed (1996), at the beginning of which he crashes the car in which he and Rebus are pursuing two young criminals; he survives but is badly hurt. He also appears in some of the stories in A Good Hanging. Rebus winds him up whenever he can and calls him \"the Clockwork Orangeman\" behind his back. Once when Rebus replied \"Right you are, sir\" Lauderdale sat in a daze: \"He\\'d said it! Rebus had actually ended a sentence with \\'sir\\'!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Inspector George Flight\\r\\nDetective Inspector George Flight of the London Metropolitan Police is in charge of the serial killer case in Tooth and Nail (1992). Rebus is sent to assist him and the two men become friends. Rebus consults him by phone in the next book, Strip Jack, where Flight remarks that Rebus persuaded him not to retire. He is also on a phone call with Rebus in the short story \"Seeing Things\" from A Good Hanging and Other Stories (1992).\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Inspector Abernethy\\r\\nDetective Inspector Abernethy is a representative of the Special Branch (Metropolitan Police). He involves himself in two of Rebus\\'s cases. In Mortal Causes (1994) he is interested in the relationships between Irish and Scottish paramilitary groups, and gun-running. In The Hanging Garden (1998) he tells Rebus that it is not in the national interest for Rebus to succeed in his efforts to persuade Mr. Lintz to talk about his activities as a Nazi.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Inspector Alister Flower\\r\\nDetective Inspector Alister Flower is based at St Leonard\\'s, Edinburgh police station in three novels, starting with The Black Book (1993). He hates Rebus, his fellow DI, because he sees him as competition. In Let it Bleed (1995), Rebus has been offered a promotion to DCI, but in Galashiels, by higher-ups who want him out of Edinburgh. After Rebus has caught Flower in several nasty activities, Flower helps Rebus in exchange for the promotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Inspector Claverhouse\\r\\nDetective Inspector Claverhouse is a Detective Sergeant, then Detective Inspector, based at the Lothian and Borders Police headquarters at Fettes as part of the Scottish Crime Squad. He works in partnership with DC/DS Ormiston and is nicknamed \"Bloody Claverhouse\". He is tall and thin with sandy hair, and fond of country and western music. He and Ormiston first appear in Mortal Causes (1994), and again in The Hanging Garden (1998) and Resurrection Men (2002), at which point the Crime Squad is evolving into Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Inspector \"Shug\" Davidson\\r\\nDetective Inspector \"Shug\" Davidson is a police officer based at Torphichen Place (West End) police station in Edinburgh. He appears in Let it Bleed (1996), Dead Souls (1999), Fleshmarket Close (2004), and Exit Music (2007). He and Rebus respect each other and he is often helpful to Rebus.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Inspector Bobby Hogan\\r\\nDetective Inspector Bobby Hogan is a police officer based at Leith police station. He appears in most of the novels from The Hanging Garden (1998) to A Question of Blood (2003). He is an intelligent cop and he and Rebus enjoy working together.\\r\\n\\r\\nInspector Malcolm Fox\\r\\nInspector Malcolm Fox is the main protagonist in the Inspector Malcolm Fox series, The Complaints (2009) and The Impossible Dead (2011), where he is an Inspector with the Lothian and Borders Complaints and Conduct (or Professional Standards) Department. In the Rebus series, starting with Saints of the Shadow Bible, (2014), he is an important point-of-view character. He is described as a bear of a man; despite this imposing physicality, his early stint in CID (including time working with John Rebus) was not a success. His brief marriage ended in divorce, after which he decided to stop drinking completely. He pays to keep his father in a nursing home until, in Even Dogs in the Wild, the old man dies; he also does his best to support his sister Jude, who is an alcoholic, a gambling addict, and full of spite. \\r\\nIn Standing in Another Man\\'s Grave (2013) he is a distant antagonist, suspicious of John Rebus. However, in Saints of the Shadow Bible he needs Rebus\\'s help on an investigation, and they develop a rapport; he also meets and admires Siobhan Clarke, and the three of them become a kind of team. In Rather Be the Devil (2016) and subsequent novels, he has been transferred to the Scottish Crime Campus at Gartcosh, but he is given assignments in Edinburgh when the Gartcosh chiefs need to be involved in a case, and then he rejoins Rebus and Clarke on their investigations. He gradually gains confidence in the field as well as in rooms full of case files. In A Song for the Dark Times, he and \\'Big Ger\\' Cafferty manipulate each other in the way Cafferty and Rebus often do.\\r\\nHe and Clarke establish a platonic relationship in Even Dogs in the Wild but it is spoiled when he is promoted to Gartcosh instead of her (and also when he allows her to be investigated for a leak to the media for which he is himself responsible). He also has a brief fling with DS Tess Leighton, between In a House of Lies and A Song for the Dark Times.\\r\\nHe also appears (based in Gartcosh) in A Heart Full of Headstones.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Inspector Derek Linford\\r\\nDetective Inspector Derek Linford is a police officer based at the Lothian and Borders Police headquarters at Fettes. He appears in Set in Darkness, The Falls, and Resurrection Men (2000-2002), though he has a significant role only in the first of these. He is ambitious and sure of his own moral high ground, qualities which do not endear him to Rebus. He takes Siobhan Clarke out on a date, but when she is no longer interested he spies on her. He is an acolyte of ACC Colin Carswell.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Inspector Jack Morton\\r\\nDetective Inspector Jack Morton is a police officer who appears Knots and Crosses, the first Rebus novel (1987), as a friend of Rebus; they are both Detective Sergeants, and have to do a lot of legwork together. Rebus re-establishes their friendship during Black and Blue (1997( when he meets him during an investigation. Morton helps him give up alcohol and paint his apartment. Afterward, though Morton returns to Falkirk, he acts as sponsor for Rebus, talking him through his temptations to drink. Rebus invites him onto an undercover operation in The Hanging Garden (1998) in which Morton is shot in the chest and killed. He becomes one of the \"ghosts\" Rebus drinks to forget.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Inspector Stefan Gilmour\\r\\nDetective Inspector Stefan Gilmour appears in Saints of the Shadow Bible (2013) and the related short story, \"Dead and Buried.\" He was in charge of a CID team at Summerhall police station in the early to mid-80s, when Rebus was posted there as a Detective Constable. When the violence and corruption of the Summerhall team was close to exposure, he resigned his post to shut down the inquiry. In Saints he has become a prominent builder of hotels and a proponent of the \"No\" vote in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Brian Holmes\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Brian Holmes is a police officer who is a trusted, though often mystified, subordinate of Rebus in the early novels and short stories. His point of view on Rebus is sometimes presented. He first appears in the novel Hide and Seek (1991) as a DC with a girlfriend, Nell Stapleton, who is a librarian at the University of Edinburgh. He is Rebus\\'s friend and closest associate in Strip Jack (1992) through Black and Blue (1997), as well as in many of the short stories published during these years. He is torn by the choice between Rebus\\'s obsessive style of policing and the more domestic life Nell wants. Finally he chooses to leave the police. To some extent his function as Rebus\\'s sounding-board is replaced by Siobhan Clarke.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Ormiston\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Ormiston is a police officer based at the Lothian and Borders Police headquarters at Fettes as part of the Scottish Crime Squad. He works in partnership with DI Claverhouse. He has greasy black hair.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Eric Bain\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Eric Bain (\"Brains\") is a police officer and computer expert based at the Lothian and Borders Police headquarters at Fettes, who appears in three novels. He provides tech support to Siobhan Clarke during The Falls (2001) and in Resurrection Men (2002) they have what seems to be a good friendship, visiting each other and sharing their interests. However, when Eric wants to take this into romantic territory, Siobhan withdraws. In The Naming of the Dead Eric turns up again, living with the gorgeous Molly; both characters twist into the plot.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Ellen Wylie\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Ellen Wylie is a police officer at Torphichen station. She first appears in Set in Darkness (2000) as part of a team from various Edinburgh police departments assigned to assess security at the as-yet-unbuilt Scottish Parliament. She and DC Grant Hood together work on assignments from Rebus; her point of view is occasionally included in the narrative. In The Falls (2001) she has a crisis when DCI Templer appoints her as Press Liaison and she is not able to handle a difficult presentation; Rebus uses her on his case but she resents the whole situation. She is active in Fleshmarket Close (2004), where Rebus is investigating a case in Torphichen territory. In The Naming of the Dead (2006), she is again assisting Rebus; she is now living with her sister, who has escaped an abusive husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Tess Leighton\\r\\nDetective Sergeant Tess Leighton is part of the Major Incident Team headed by Detective Chief Inspector Graham Sutherland in In a House of Lies and A Song for the Dark Times. She is tall, slim, pale, intelligent, and interested in men. She and Malcolm Fox have a few dates. Her colleagues on this team in the two books include DS George Gamble and DC Phil Yeats.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Constable Robert Burns\\r\\nDetective Constable Robert Burns (\"Rab\") appears in The Black Book (where he is a Detective Sergeant), Mortal Causes and Let it Bleed, always stationed at Torphichen (West End). He is a member of the Free Church of Scotland (the \"Wee Frees\") and preaches damnation on The Mound on Sundays. In Mortal Causes, he is a native of the Pilmuir housing estate and helps Rebus with his foray into this dangerous area, full of young thugs.  In the other books, he is generally helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Constable Grant Hood\\r\\nDetective Constable Grant Hood is a police officer who was based at St Leonards. He is a big fan of new technology and gadgets. During The Falls he is attracted to Siobhan Clarke, and attempts to kiss her. During the same novel he takes on a media liaison role, a position he takes up in a number of subsequent investigations.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Constable \"Hi-Ho\" Silvers\\r\\nDetective Constable George \"Hi-Ho\" Silvers is a police officer who was based at St Leonards. He is described as \"coasting towards his pension.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nDetective Constable Christine Esson\\r\\nDetective Constable Christine Esson is part of the Gayfield Square police station CID starting with Saints of the Shadow Bible (2013). She is a social media expert. Rebus thinks she looks like Audrey Hepburn (In a House of Lies, Chapter 25). She works with databases and, when cold cases necessitate it, archives, researching leads not only for DI Siobhan Clarke but also for Rebus, who may or may not have any official status at Gayfield. She is paired with another detective, Ronnie Ogilvie.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice Constable Toni Jackson\\r\\nPolice Constable Toni Jackson is a police officer who is based at St Leonards. She frequently encourages Siobhan Clarke to socialise with the other female officers.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolice associates\\r\\nProfessor Gates\\r\\nProfessor \"Sandy\" Gates is a forensic pathologist who appears frequently in the Rebus series between 1996 and 2006. He and Dr. Curt are the usual medical examiners who dissect the bodies of victims. In 2013\\'s Saints of the Shadow Bible (Chapter 13) we hear that he has been dead for some years.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoctor Curt\\r\\nDoctor Curt is a forensic pathologist and medical examiner who appears frequently in the Rebus series, beginning in 1992 with Strip Jack and ending with The Naming of the Dead (2006). He is junior to the formidable Sandy Gates, although both men are eminent figures in their profession. His fearless sense of humour is a  precision instrument.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Deborah Quant\\r\\nProfessor Deborah Quant is a forensic pathologist, medical examiner, and professor who appears in the Rebus novels starting with Saints of the Shadow Bible (2013). She also figures, below, in the list of Rebus\\'s personal relationships.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther associates\\r\\nJim Stevens\\r\\nJim Stevens is a journalist hostile to Rebus. He first appears in Knots and Crosses (1987), where he is a strong point-of view character as he pursues a story about Rebus\\'s spectacular corruption; when this thesis fails him, he moves to London. Rankin featured him in his 1988 spy novel, Watchman, a non-Rebus book. Stevens returns to the Rebus series in full force in Dead Souls (1999), where he tries to write a book about a serial killer and becomes his subject\\'s victim.\\r\\n\\r\\nMatthew Vanderhyde\\r\\nProfessor Matthew Vanderhyde is a retired professor and, supposedly, warlock. He is blind, but has not always been so, and he is a fund of Edinburgh history. Rebus meets him in Hide and seek (1991) when Rebus is investigating an apparently occult murder scene. He appears in The Black Book, where he focuses Rebus on the Central Hotel fire five years earlier, and in Mortal Causes, where he is a source of information about Sword and Shield, a pro-Scottish independence group of the past. In The Hanging Garden he is in the background, and he is mentioned as being still alive in Set in Darkness (2000). In The Falls (2001) there is mention of Victorian witchcraft and modern Wicca, but Rebus does not consult Vanderhyde, which suggests he has died.\\r\\n\\r\\nMairie Henderson\\r\\nMairie Henderson first appears in The Black Book (1993) as a \"hungry\" young newspaper reporter—not only for stories, but for food; Rebus frequently treats her to a meal. She gives him information from the newspaper\\'s archives, and he gives her leads on cases he is working on. The relationship continues through Dead Souls (1999), where she refuses to help Rebus destroy the life of an ex-con. Mairie returns in The Naming of the Dead (2006), having published a successful book on \\'Big Ger\\' Cafferty, presenting him as a romantic figure, a reformed gangster; he, however, gets all the profits from the book. She helps Rebus investigate arms deals in that book. She is also mentioned in Exit Music (2007).\\r\\n\\r\\nSteve Holly\\r\\nSteve Holly is a scurrilous Glasgow-based reporter who appears in The Falls (2001), A Question of Blood (2003), and Fleshmarket Close (2004). His goal is to find the most sensational aspect of a story.\\r\\n\\r\\nLaura Smith\\r\\nLaura Smith is the crime reporter for The Scotsman, beginning in Saints of the Shadow Bible (2013). She is a friend of DI Siobhan Clarke.\\r\\n\\r\\nCriminals\\r\\nMorris Gerald \"Big Ger\" Cafferty\\r\\nMorris Gerald Cafferty (\"Big Ger\") is a notorious Edinburgh crime boss and a frequent antagonist throughout the Rebus series. Although he has a brief cameo in the third novel Tooth and Nail, he first appears as a main character in The Black Book. Physically intimidating, as well as being ruthless and manipulative, he is one of Scotland\\'s most powerful gangsters. He controls an organization that can apply intimidation, coercion, bribery, and murder to achieve his goals, but he is quite willing to wield these tools personally.\\r\\nCafferty was born on 18 October 1946 and by the 1980s he had become the controlling crime boss of Edinburgh. His relationship with Rebus ranges from outright hostility to an uneasy partnership. Cafferty habitually mocks Rebus by calling him \\'Strawman\\', a nickname based on a court officer\\'s error in calling Rebus to testify at a trial. The two men are about the same age and are sometimes described as looking like brothers, as they get older. As a result of their relationship, Rebus is often accused of being \\'in Cafferty\\'s pocket\\'.\\r\\nAt the end of The Black Book (1993), Rebus is able to arrest him on ample evidence. Cafferty is sent to HM Prison Barlinnie, whose warden falls under his control. In Mortal Causes (1994), Cafferty\\'s son is murdered; Cafferty, in prison, helps Rebus find the killer, and then breaks out (temporarily) to exact revenge. During Cafferty\\'s incarceration, Rebus keeps returning to Cafferty for assistance, which Cafferty either provides, refuses, or disguises with misdirection, usually dropping an inadvertent clue or two. For example, he assigns the Weasel to help Rebus locate the driver who hit Rebus\\'s daughter in The Hanging Garden (1998). In Set in Darkness (2000), Cafferty engineers a curtailment of his prison term on compassionate grounds (he has faked having cancer), and Rebus is horrified to find him singing Robert Burns in public. Cafferty, however, suggests that he will henceforward be a respectable real-estate tycoon instead of a gangster.\\r\\nIn later novels, Cafferty is a near-permanent figure, claiming to have gone straight while retaining criminal control of Edinburgh from behind the scenes. He is often linked to cases that Rebus and Clarke are investigating, but there is never enough evidence to bring charges against him.\\r\\nIn Exit Music (2007), an impending move to arrest, convict, and disempower Cafferty is forestalled when he is assaulted and hospitalized, comatose. On the final page, his heart flatlines and Rebus desperately tries to revive him, lest Cafferty have a \\'cold, cleansed death\\'.  The book ends without revealing the results of Rebus\\'s resuscitation attempt.  In the next Rebus novel, Standing in Another Man\\'s Grave (2012), we discover that Cafferty survived,  though he seems somewhat subdued and stripped of power.\\r\\nIn Rather Be the Devil (2016), however, Cafferty seizes control of a string of Edinburgh bars and betting-shops, and he continues to thrive in In a House of Lies (2018). He also a leading character in A Song for the Dark Times (2020) and (in a wheelchair) in A Heart Full of Headstones (2022).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Weasel\\r\\nThe Weasel is Cafferty\\'s second in command, who represents him in Edinburgh while he is in HM Prison Barlinnie. Cafferty informs Rebus that the Weasel\\'s surname is Jeffries. He gained the nickname from Rebus for looking like a weasel. His shabby appearance disguises his important rôle in Cafferty\\'s organisation. In The Hanging Garden, the Weasel finds the juvenile joyrider who knocked down Sammy Rebus, and is ready to facilitate Rebus\\'s revenge on him; Rebus, however, is horrified when he realizes his great enemy is only a child. In Resurrection Men, Claverhouse and Ormiston plan to blackmail the Weasel into giving them Cafferty. This involves the Weasel\\'s son, who had been running drugs behind Cafferty\\'s back, and a huge stash of drugs meant to bait a trap. The plan goes badly awry, with Cafferty triumphing. The careers of Claverhouse and ACC Colin Carswell are devastated. Cafferty tells Rebus that the Weasel is history, implying that his intended betrayal was discovered and he was killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarryl Christie\\r\\nDarryl Christie is a young Edinburgh gangster who appears in the later Rebus novels. He is the teenage brother of a serial killer\\'s victim in Standing in Another Man\\'s Grave (2012), but he has a plan to take over the business of his mother\\'s lover, a gangster. When he accomplishes this, he and Cafferty agree to respect each other. In Saints of the Shadow Bible (2013) he trades favors with Rebus, and in Even Dogs in the Wild (2014) he saves Fox\\'s life. However, in Rather be the Devil (2015) he has overextended his empire; Cafferty, wanting to get power back, engineers serious trouble for him. Darryl kills a man for the first time, in self-defense, and then madly wants to shoot Cafferty and a swindler colleague; Rebus arrests him, and Cafferty takes over his businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nRebus\\'s personal life\\r\\nRhona\\r\\nRhona is Rebus\\'s ex-wife. When she married him, she was divorced. She teaches English in school. She appears primarily in three novels: she is part of Rebus\\'s background in the first novel, Knots and Crosses (1987); in Tooth and Nail (1992) Rebus visits her and Sammy in London; and in The Hanging Garden (1998) she comes to Edinburgh to sit by Sammy\\'s bedside after the latter\\'s accident (bringing her current partner with her). In A Song for the Dark Times (2020), we read that \"Rhona had died a few years back\" (chapter 2), perhaps before her granddaughter Carrie was born.\\r\\nIn Set in Darkness (2000) Rebus recalls how strongly Rhona supported Scottish independence in the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum, and he maps the failure of their relationship against the transition from arguing actively about it to silent provocation and finally his own failure to vote at all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSammy\\r\\nSamantha \"Sammy\" Rebus is the only child of Rebus and Rhona, born around 1975 (since she is \"nearly twelve\" in 1987\\'s Knots and Crosses). She progresses from a child to an adult over the course of the series. In Knots and Crosses she is kidnapped by a serial killer with a personal vendetta against her father. After this traumatic experience, Rhona moves with her to London, where Rebus catches up with them in Tooth and Nail (1992) and discourages an ill-chosen boyfriend. In Let it Bleed (1996), Samantha moves back to Edinburgh and is under the wing of Patience Aitkin, her father\\'s ex; she is working for a group that helps prisoners, a career choice that is hostile to her father\\'s. At the end of this novel, she and her father show some tenderness for each other.\\r\\nIn The Hanging Garden (1998), she is living with a journalist, Ned Farlowe, but she is hospitalized after a hit-and-run, and in a coma for most of the book, reuniting her parents, Patience, and Michael Rebus at her bedside. In Dead Souls (1999) she is in a wheelchair but working hard at physical therapy in the expectation of being able to walk; she is still living with Ned Farlowe.\\r\\nOtherwise, until Rebus\\'s retirement in 2007, she remains a shadowy figure, someone now distant he thinks he ought to call. In Standing in Another Man\\'s Grave (2012) Rebus makes the effort to visit her home near Tongue, Highland, but no-one is home; when he phones her afterward, she explains that her partner Keith Grant has a good job dismantling a nuclear plant and that they are trying for a second time to conceive via IVF. This is evidently successful, and in Even Dogs in the Wild (2015) Rebus visits her and her daughter Carrie, who is two; he also recalls holding a newborn Carrie. In A Song for the Dark Times (2020), Samantha is distraught when Keith goes missing; Rebus arrives to investigate what turns out to be a murder in which Sam is the obvious suspect.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarrie\\r\\nCarrie is the granddaughter of John Rebus, born around 2013 to Samantha and Keith Grant who was murdered; see A Song for the Dark Times (2020). Carrie was conceived by IVF - a final throw of the dice. She is growing up in a small town in the far north of Scotland.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichael\\r\\nMichael Rebus (\"Mickey\") is John\\'s younger brother, who followed their father\\'s career as a stage hypnotist. Although he and John look alike, their personalities are very different. Michael has a faithful wife (Chrissie), children, and a nice car. He is an important character in Knots and Crosses (1987), where he is picking up money dealing drugs and eventually goes to prison for it; he also hypnotizes John, allowing him to access traumatic memories of his SAS \"training\" to solve a case and also to resolve his undiagnosed PTSD. In The Black Book (1993) Michael turns up after doing his prison time and crashes at John\\'s apartment, even though it has been rented to students. Although he seems carefree, doing drugs and sleeping with one of the students, he is reading up on therapeutic hypnosis and seems ready to make a career change; at the end of the book, he is going back to his family. Michael shows up at Samantha\\'s bedside in The Hanging Garden (1998), and he is often mentioned in succeeding books as someone Rebus thinks he should get in touch with. The Naming of the Dead (2006) opens with his funeral, and Rebus\\'s difficulty in mourning his brother is an underlying current in that novel.\\r\\n\\r\\nPatience Aitken\\r\\nDoctor Patience Aitken, a general practitioner, is a romantic partner for Rebus beginning with Strip Jack (1992). He decides to move in with her and rent out his own apartment, but in The Black Book (1993) she is fed up with his inability to schedule any time for her, and she kicks him out. In Mortal Causes (1994) he is back living at her flat. In the following novel, Let it Bleed (1995), Rebus\\'s daughter Samantha is the one living with Patience, and he must be invited to visit them; neither woman is comfortable with him. He shuts Patience\\'s cat, with which he has always had an uneasy relationship, out of the house, where it is attacked and killed.\\r\\n\\r\\nJean Burchill\\r\\nJean Burchill, a museum curator, meets Rebus in The Falls (2001), where she assists him with his investigation and is imperiled by it. They immediately hit it off and start a relationship. By the time of the next novel, Resurrection Men, Rebus is struggling to maintain the relationship, and in the subsequent novel A Question of Blood (2003), the romance is close to ending. However, when Deborah Quant first meets Rebus in Saints of the Shadow Bible (2013), she pointedly asks him whether he still visits the museum where Jean works.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeborah Quant\\r\\nDeborah Quant, a medical examiner and university professor, first appears in Saints of the Shadow Bible (2013), where she is described from Rebus\\'s point of view as having red hair and blue eyes and being in her mid-forties, but with no wedding ring (chapter 22). They flirt a little, and by the last page of the novel Rebus has a date with her. They are known to be going out during Even Dogs in the Wild. Rather Be the Devil opens and closes with Rebus and Quant having dinner out; she has given him the gift of a diseased lung in a jar of formaldehyde to help him stop smoking. In the Prologue to A Song for the Dark Times (2020) she defines the relationship as \"friends with benefits.\" See above under \"Police Associates\".\\r\\n\\r\\nBrillo\\r\\nIn Even Dogs in the Wild there is a small dog, a wire-haired terrier, astray in Cafferty\\'s neighborhood. After several visits there, Rebus takes the dog home and, finding that no-one else wants a dog, adopts it. During its time boarding with a vet it acquired the name Brillo.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Leary\\r\\nFather Conor Leary is an elderly, intellectual Catholic priest and a friend of Rebus. They meet in The Black Book (1993) when Rebus, on impulse, enters a confessional; he later goes to Mass hoping to see the priest who had spoken to him. In Mortal Causes (1994) it is clear that they have had many conversations over a Guinness, and Leary asks Rebus to pay attention to the Catholic youth center in Pilmuir, propelling him into a major plot thread. In The Hanging Garden (1998) Father Leary is taking a lot of medicine, and in Dead Souls (1999) Rebus visits him in the hospital. In The Falls (2001)  Conor Leary suffers a brain haemorrhage while attending a surgeons\\' dinner and dies instantly, falling over a railing.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nIan Rankin Official website', 'Hans Gieng (first mentioned 1525 – died 1562) was a Swiss Renaissance sculptor best known for his public fountain figures in the Old Town of Bern as well as Fribourg.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nGieng, who was probably of Swabian origin, is recorded to have become a citizen of Fribourg and a member of the traders\\' guild in 1527. He likely first worked in the sculpture workshop of Hans Geiler, whom he succeeded in 1533. In earlier centuries, Geiler and Gieng were sometimes confused with one another, but modern research indicates that they were actually two distinct persons.\\r\\nAs a sculptor, Gieng was mainly active in Fribourg. He also worked in Bern in the 1540s, in Solothurn from 1554–56, and in 1557 in St. Gallen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nGieng\\'s style is close to Swabian art: traditional and still in the style of Gothic art in his religious creations, but forceful and realistic in the secular works.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreiburg\\r\\nIn Freiburg, the Renaissance council table (1546) and the figures of the seven public fountains (1547–60), considered the most significant ensemble of sculptural art from this period in Switzerland, are among his principal works.\\r\\n\\r\\nBern\\r\\nGieng created several if not most of the public fountains of Bern that were put up between 1542 and 1546. His presence in the city is sparsely attested in the surviving record: a 1543 Council diary entry reports a “Meyster Hans, Bildhower, im grossen Spital z\\'Herbrig sin und an des spittelmeisters tisch ässen” (“Master Hans, sculptor, residing in the great Hospital and eating at the Spitalmaster\\'s table”).\\r\\nFor this reason, his authorship of the individual fountain figures, which are unsigned, has long been a matter of dispute. Paul Schenk\\'s seminal work of 1945, Berner Brunnen-Chronik (Bernese Fountain Chronicle) attributes three fountains to Gieng with certainty—the Pfeiferbrunnen (piper fountain), the Kindlifresserbrunnen (ogre fountain) and the Simsonbrunnen (Samson fountain)—while considering it \"quite possible\" that Gieng also created the other wells. Later works such as Paul Hofer\\'s Kunstdenkmäler des Kantons Bern of 1952 or Berchtold Weber\\'s Historisch-topographisches Lexikon der Stadt Bern of 1976 are virtually certain of Gieng\\'s authorship of most Bernese fountains.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther works\\r\\nOther works attributed to Gieng include monumental crucifixes, stonework in the church of Tafers, statues, tombstones, and heraldic motifs.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nOld Town of Berne\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\n Marianne Rolle: Hans Gieng in  German, French and Italian in the online Historical Dictionary of Switzerland.\\r\\nHans Gieng, Bildhauer on g26.ch (in German)\\r\\nDie Stadtbrunnen on g26.ch (in German)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== Notes ==', 'Hot Copy is an American old-time radio mystery drama.

Since beginning his art career in the 1950s, he has been primarily active in Cuba, the United States, and Europe. He is among the significant contributing artists to the establishment of Cuban art in South Florida during the 20th century. His artwork has gained recognition for his awards, use in public art, coverage in media and published Cuban art literature, as well as international exhibitions. Hernandez is included in the permanent collection of the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana, the Museum of Geometric and MADI Art, the City of Hialeah, and the Miami-Dade Public Library System.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and career in Cuba\\r\\nPedro Hernández Domínguez was born on August 11, 1932, in Havana, Cuba. He was the only child of Havana medical doctor Pedro Lorenzo Hernández Gómez and his wife Eliosa Domínguez Lopez. Hernández was subsequently raised in Havana and attended the Instituto Edison de La Habana for both his primary and secondary education. He then pursued dual careers in medicine and the arts as a sculptor, graduating with his doctorate in medicine from the University of Havana in 1957. That same year he participated in his first art exhibition in which he quickly established himself and was awarded the Third Prize in Sculpture at the Círculo de Bellas Artes of Havana. Following this debut, Hernández was invited the following year by artist Raquel Lazaro, then-president of Havana\\'s prestigious Lyceum Lawn Tennis Club, to participate in the Lyceum\\'s collective 1958 exhibition Artistas Noveles.\\r\\n1959 would be a formative year for Hernández early career. That year he was accepted into and participated in the Annual Exhibition of Fine Arts (Painting, Sculpture and Engraving) at the Palacio de Bellas Artes of Havana with other leading Cuban sculptors including Roberto Estopiñán, Enrique Gay Garcia, Tomas Olivia, and Rudolfo Tardo. Hernández also exhibited his sculpture Trio at the prominent Cuban art gallery Color Luz, owned by the painters Loló Soldevilla and Pedro de Oraá.\\r\\nWhile immersing himself in the Havana art scene, he was introduced to leading Cuban Vanguardia artist Victor Manuel, regarded as the Father of Modern Cuban Art, in 1959 by their mutual friend, Cuban painter Jorge Perez Castaño. Hernández and Victor Manuel became close friends and would exhibit together. Hernández would also become connected to other prominent Cuban artists in this period including Amelia Peláez and Jose Maria Mijares.\\r\\nDuring the 1960s, Hernández\\' art career expanded to become active internationally. In 1960 he was selected among the artists chosen to represent Cuba in the InterAmerican Biennial in Mexico. In 1964 Hernández began to work in clay after being inspired by witnessing the ceramic works of Amelia Peláez and her assistant Merallo. In 1965, Hernández held a joint exhibition with Victor Manuel displaying Hernández\\'s sculptures alongside Manuel\\'s paintings at the Lyceum Tennis Club. The showing was met with acclaim and gave Hernández significant further exposure for his art career through coverage by major Cuban media of the time, including by prominent Cuban art critic Loló de la Torriente of El Mundo. The rest of the decade would see Hernández relocate and establish his art beyond Cuba.\\r\\n\\r\\nArt career in the United States\\r\\nHernández and his family left Cuba in 1968. After initially staying in Spain, they permanently resettled in Miami in 1969 where they joined the Cuban exile community there. In 1971 he became connected to the Romanian artist Gigi Aramescu who would become another close associate and significant influence on his art.\\r\\nOne decade following his joint exhibition with Victor Manuel at Havana\\'s Lyceum Tennis Club, Hernández resumed his exhibiting career with the first showing of his art in United States as part of the 1975 Semana de la Cultura Cubana collective exhibition in the University of Miami. In 1977 Hernández exhibited in the second Re-Encuentro Cubano exhibition alongside other prominent Cuban artists in exile such as Rafael Soriano, and Gabriel Sorzano, and Grupo GALA-founder Enrique Riveron. Hernández would also participate in the third installment of the exhibition in 1978. Also in 1978, Hernandez collaborated with artist and Miami-Dade Public Library System Community Relations Director Margarita Cano to participate in fourteen annual exhibitions in various system libraries. Two would be solo exhibitions of Hernández\\'s work: one 1982 at the registered landmark Coral Gables Library, and another in 1986 at the Coral Reef Library. Hernández would also enter the Miami-Dade Public Library System\\'s permanent collection, which had been founded by Cano.\\r\\nThe late 1970s and early 1980s would be another pivotal period in Hernández\\'s career. In a major development, Hernández expanded his output beyond sculpture in 1979 with the development of what would be called “cut drawings” by critic and curator Juan Espinosa Almodóvar. Made from layers of cut colored paper with forms that evoked his organic sculptures, Hernández\\'s cut-drawings have been recognized as innovative by many art critics including Almodóvar, Armando Alvarez Bravo, and Margarita Cano, and would grow to become one of his signature mediums alongside wood sculpture. The following year, Hernández joined the international Biomorphism art movement in 1980 after being influenced by the work of Hans Arp. That year he also participated in Re-Encuetro Cubano\\'s last major exhibition, spotlighting the then-contemporary Peruvian Havana Embassy crisis, during which 10865 Cuban took refuge in Havana\\'s Peruvian Embassy.\\r\\nIn 1981 Hernández participated in the Miami Tumble performance art piece, the first work of street art in Miami, organized by Margarita Cano alongside contributions by other leading contemporary artists such as Andy Warhol, Barbara Young, and Lowell Nesbitt. In 1982 he began signing his works as simply \"Pedro Hernández\" (as opposed to “Hernández Domínguez”) and also began to work with bronze as a new sculptural medium. He is also the subject of a solo exhibition in the Coral Gables Library, which includes his wood sculptures as well as his Blue Series of cut-drawings. The following year Hernández was awarded the CINTAS Foundation for Visual Arts in sculpture of 1983–1984.\\r\\nIn 1987 Hernández participated in a collective exhibition in Tonneins-Bordeaux, France coordinated by International Art Connection, for which he won an award for one of his cut-drawings, El Teide. The following year another of his cut-drawings, the triptych Medusa, was exhibited in the Palais du Luxembourg. In 1991 Hernández created a conceptual “forest” art installation of free-standing wood beams for the Metro Resource Center in downtown Miami.\\r\\nIn 1998 Hernandez exhibited with the New London Art Society Gallery in Connecticut as well as in the launch of O&Y Gallery in Coral Gables with noted Cuban painter Miguel Ordoqui. O&Y Gallery, overseen by artistic director Alina Marrero, would represent Hernández for much of the following decade from 1998 to 2007, in which time Hernández exhibited frequently. Significant exhibitions of Hernández\\'s work from his time with O&Y Gallery included Medusa (2000), Maison des Dames (2003), and Venezia, La Serenissima (2007).\\r\\nAnother pivotal development in Hernández\\'s career came with the new millennium as he further expanded his oeuvre into the mediums of soapstone and alabaster. In 2001, his cut drawing Horizon was accepted into and featured in the 2nd World Festival of Art on Paper, held in Bled, Slovenia. That same year Hernández was recruited to participate in Absolut Chalk, a large-scale street art project in Miami Beach sponsored by Absolut Vodka.\\r\\nIn 2006 Hernández was selected and commissioned to produce the large scale metal sculpture Hialeah Beat as a public artwork for the City of Hialeah through its Art in Public Places Program. The piece was later exhibited in the 2024 exhibition In Plain Sight: Public Art in Miami x Artists of Cuban Heritage in Belen Jesuit’s Saladrigas Gallery. In 2008 he was the subject of a solo exhibition in Stonington, Connecticut organized by painters Guido Garaycochea and José Ulloa featuring both sculpture and cut-drawings. Two years later he exhibited additional cut-drawings in Connecticut\\'s Lyman Allyn Art Museum.\\r\\n2012 was another transition period in Hernández career in which he expanded his involvement in exhibitions into curation. That year he began curating the 7 Plus One Art Project, and has since curated other exhibitions. Hernández \\'s involvement in the 7 Plus One Art Project came through Cuban artist Emilio Hector Rodriguez with the initial concept centered on exhibiting seven painters and one sculptor. Also in 2012, Hernández\\'s own work began a stylist shift towards geometric abstraction. This shift was the shown in the collective exhibition Lines: Contemporary Geometric Abstraction held at Cremata Art Gallery.\\r\\nIn July 2015, Hernández was the focus of the solo exhibition Geometry in Motion in Miami Dade College\\'s West Campus with text by art historian Anelys Álvarez Muñoz.\\r\\nIn 2019 he was included in the The Museum of Geometric and MADI Art\\'s 2019 biennale and accepted into their permanent collection.\\r\\nIn 2024 he was the subject of the solo exhibition Pedro Hernandez: Geometric Abstraction in the Museum of Contemporary Art of The Americas. The exhibition showcased his later-career focus on geometric abstraction since 2012, particularly through his cut-drawings and ceramic plates.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtwork analysis\\r\\nHernández\\'s artwork has been extensively critiqued by noted critics of Cuban and American art, including José Gómez-Sicre, Loló de la Torriente, Juan Espinosa Almodóvar, Rafael Casalíns, Armando Alvarez Bravo, and Lillian Dobbs.\\r\\nHis sculpture works are considered part of the international Biomorphism movement and known for their organic and fluid qualities that convey movement. While often abstract, his works have frequently been associated with sensual or poetic themes. Hernandez also frequently incorporates elements of color, such as blue patina, into the grooves of his sculptures to emphasize and enhance their forms. Within his creative process, Hernández has stated in interviews that he never begins his works with any objective or goal for the piece, instead utilizing an intuitive process that responds to the unique qualities he finds within the medium he is working with. As a multimedia and interdisciplinary artist, Hernández is most known for his work in wood, though he has also worked within the mediums of stone, metal, marble, alabaster, paper, ceramic as well as mixed media, conceptual, and installation art.\\r\\nDespite being an autodidact, Hernández art has been influenced by the work of other artists. De la Torriente, Alvarez Bravo, and other critics have noted influence from Cuban artists Wifredo Lam and Agustin Cárdenas while Hernández has also acknowledged influence from European artists Hans Arp and Gigi Aramescu. Hernández has also drawn inspiration from various multicultural sources. His cut-drawings have been influenced by Panamanian molas and his broader oeuvre has drawn influence from the stylistic fluidity of Art Nouveau movement as well as elements of African art and art of New Guinea.\\r\\nIn de la Torriente\\'s critique of Hernández\\'s joint exhibition with Victor Manuel, she assessed that Hernández \"is a great and pure sculptor who extracts all the values from the piece he is working on [...]. His vertical works Jibacoa, Enlace, and Erosion contain a beauty that stylizes human aspirations. The horizontals [...] display an imaginative flight and recreate a harmonic serenity that compete with dreams.\"\\r\\nAmong Hernández\\'s significant works is his Medusa series. Spanning several mediums, the series began in the 1980s through his paper cut-drawings medium and, in 2000, the series was also among Hernández\\'s first forays into stone sculpture, reinforced by its conceptual ties to the Greek myth of Medusa. Works from the series have been exhibited in the United States in Europe. Key works include the triptych Medusa Antillana (1989, cut-drawing), The Eye (2000, cut-drawing), Land of the Gorgons (2000, cut-drawing), Aegean Medusa (2000, cut-drawing), and The Eye of the Serpent (2000, black soapstone sculpture). The series was the focus of Hernández\\'s 2000 Coral Gables solo exhibition Medusa in O&Y Gallery.\\r\\nSince 2012, Hernández work has increasingly shifted into an embrace of abstract and geometric art. His work since this shift has been featured the The Museum of Geometric and MADI Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art of The Americas.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecognition and legacy\\r\\nThroughout his six decade career, Hernández\\'s work has been covered extensively in media, including by Diario Las Americas, The Miami Herald, The Miami News, El Mundo, Revista Replica, La Peregrina Magazine, Florida Exclusive Magazine, La Voz, ARTDISTRICTS Magazine, and Nagari Magazine. He has also been mentioned in published literature of Cuban art, including the books books Cuban Art in Exile by José Gómez Sicre (1989), El Arte Cubano En El Exilio by Armando Alvarez Bravo (2015), Escultura en Cuba: Siglo XX by Jose Veigas Zamora (2005), and Cuban-American Art in Miami: Exile, Identity, and the Neo-Baroque by Lynette M.F. Bosch (2004). In 2013 he was the subject of book Pedro Hernández: Line in Movement, the first official monograph of his career produced with his participation.\\r\\nHernández has exhibited his work in the United States, Europe and Latin America, including in New York City, Washington D.C., Miami, Connecticut, France, Cuba, Slovenia, Panama, Costa Rica, and Luxembourg. In addition to commercial fine art galleries, his work has been featured in several museums, cultural centers, and venues such as the Koubek Center, the Lyman Allyn Art Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Art of The Americas, Museum of Geometric and MADI Art, the Cuban Museum of Art and Culture, Museo de Bellas Artes, Mexico, D.F., Musée du Luxembourg, Palacio de Bellas Artes de la Habana, and the Palais du Luxembourg.\\r\\nHe has also shown his work in educational venues and libraries such as the University of Miami, University of Connecticut, Miami Dade College, Florida International University, Connecticut College, Belen Jesuit Preparatory School, and the Miami-Dade Public Library System.\\r\\nOutside of traditional art venues and circuits, Hernández has also been commissioned for public art and collaborated with established companies and organizations such as Absolut Vodka and Miami Children\\'s Hospital, as well as participated in charity art auctions.\\r\\nHe exhibited his work alongside other prominent Cuban artists such as painters Victor Manuel, Rafael Soriano, Enrique Riveron, Lourdes Gómez Franca, sculptors Enrique Gay Garcia, Tony Lopez, Rafael Consuegra, and Gabriel Sorzano. He has also exhibited with international artists not of Cuban heritage, such as Gigi Aramescu, Neith Nevelson, and Roxana McAllister-Kelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAwards\\r\\nHernández\\'s work has been recognized with several awards throughout his career in Cuba, the United States, and France.

She first appeared in the pilot episode of the series in 2000 and appeared in every episode until the series finale in 2007. Bledel\\'s performance on the show earned her a Young Artist Award, a Family Television Award and two Teen Choice Awards. She also received nominations for an ALMA Award, a Satellite Award, and a Saturn Award.\\r\\n\\r\\nBackground\\r\\nRory is the only daughter of Lorelai Gilmore, and the first-born daughter of Christopher Hayden. She was born October 8, 1984, in Hartford, Connecticut, at 4:03 am. Every year at that exact time, Lorelai wakes Rory up to tell her the story of her birth. Because Lorelai gave birth to Rory when she was only sixteen, the two are more like friends than mother and daughter. Rory shares her mother\\'s taste in junk food, coffee, movies, music, and much more. She spent her first months living with her mother at her grandparents\\' mansion until her mother ran away. The rest of her childhood she spent in the Independence Inn in Stars Hollow where her mother worked originally as a maid. The two lived in the potting shed behind the inn where Jackson\\'s cousin Rune lived in later seasons. Eventually, Lorelai was able to buy a nice house where Rory spent her adolescent years. Rory did not have much contact with her grandparents until she started to attend Chilton.\\r\\n\\r\\nStorylines\\r\\nRory dreams of studying at Harvard University and gets accepted into the prestigious and fictional Chilton Academy, where she stays for her sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school. To pay tuition, Lorelai asks for money from her estranged wealthy parents, Richard and Emily. They agree to pay for Rory\\'s education on the condition that the two come to their house every Friday night for dinner. Before leaving Stars Hollow High School, Rory meets Dean Forester (Jared Padalecki). Rory almost convinced herself not to go to Chilton because of not wanting to leave Dean, but after learning of the huge sacrifices her mother made, she decides to go to Chilton. Rory and Dean date for two seasons, only breaking up once when Dean told Rory he loved her on their 3-month anniversary, and she replied that she would have to think about it, but they eventually reconcile. Dean escorts Rory when she is presented to society at a debutante ball hosted by her grandmother\\'s chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. During her time at Chilton, Rory becomes engaged in a feud with close academic rival, Paris Geller. Though the two later become friends, the rivalry continues into their university studies. Rory reluctantly agrees to run as Paris\\'s vice president for student government and wins. She also writes for the Chilton paper, The Franklin. Rory and Paris join the \"Puffs\", a secret sorority at Chilton.\\r\\nWhen she meets Jess Mariano (Milo Ventimiglia), Rory begins to fall in love with him. They become friends first but start to date after Dean breaks up with Rory because he sees that Rory likes Jess. However, various problems make their relationship difficult. After Jess skips school to go to work at Walmart, causing him to be unable to graduate or to take Rory to Prom, Jess decides to leave to go to California to see his estranged father, effectively breaking up with Rory. Jess does not tell Rory he is leaving, but later calls and does not say anything on the phone, until Rory caught on that it was him and revealed that she might have loved him but would just have to get over it. Later that year, still upset, Jess returns and tells Rory that he loves her and then leaves again.\\r\\nAfter graduating Chilton as valedictorian and with a 4.2 GPA, Rory goes on to attend Yale University, her grandfather\\'s alma mater, in season four—although her entire life she had wanted to go to Harvard—having decided that the benefits of Yale outweighed her dream of studying at Harvard. During her freshman year, Rory resides at Durfee Hall and shares a dorm room with Tana, Janet, and fellow Chilton alumna Paris Geller. She moves to Branford College, the same residential college that her grandfather, Richard Gilmore, lived in, at the beginning of her sophomore year. There she shares a dorm room with Paris. At Yale, Rory majors in English and pursues her interest in journalism; she wants to be a foreign correspondent and her role model is Christiane Amanpour. She writes for the Yale Daily News and is its editor towards the end of her studies.\\r\\nWhile at Yale, Rory reconnects with Dean, who married Lindsay (a fellow schoolmate from Stars Hollow High), straight after high school, but it is soon clear that he impulsively did it as a rebound from Rory. During the same period, Jess shows up unexpectedly at Yale to see Rory, and asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. Dean gets jealous but he and Rory grow closer and have an affair, during which Rory loses her virginity. Lorelai is angry and disappointed in Rory, who decides to leave for Europe with her grandmother for the summer to avoid conflicts. Shortly after, Dean separates from Lindsay and the two continue seeing each other. They break up after Dean arrives at the Gilmore mansion to see that Rory— wearing a family diamond tiara, earrings, and necklace— is having a coming out party attended by male students from Yale.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Rory makes the acquaintance of the heir to the Huntzberger Publishing Company, Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry), whom invites her to join a Yale secret society called the Life and Death Brigade. She soon becomes interested in him and after Dean breaks up with her (she was detained at a party arranged by her grandparents to introduce her to the wealthy and eligible sons of their Yale alumni friends, including Logan), she makes the first move at her grandparents\\' vow-renewal. Their relationship begins casually as a \"no strings attached\" affair because Logan makes it clear that he does not want to commit to a relationship.\\r\\nHowever, as time passes, Rory grows dissatisfied with their open relationship, and after a day of drunken introspection, she suggests they should end their sexual relationship and be friends because she is \"a girlfriend kind of girl.\" Logan interprets this as an ultimatum and unexpectedly agrees to date her exclusively. At her first time to dinner at Logan’s family home, the Huntzbergers reject Rory as a fit girlfriend for their son because of her aspirations to work and her background. However, Logan affirms his commitment to their relationship, although the pressure exerted by the Huntzbergers continues to dog the couple.\\r\\nTo make amends, Logan\\'s father, Mitchum Huntzberger, gives Rory an internship at one of his newspapers, the Stamford Eagle Gazette. At the end of her internship, Mitchum tells Rory that she does not have what it takes to be a journalist, although she would make a good assistant. Upset and angry, Rory cajoles Logan into leaving his sister’s engagement party, held at a marina, to steal a yacht and vent her frustration. When apprehended, Rory is sentenced to 300 hours of community service and rethinks her lifelong ambitions and current path at Yale. Her decision to take time off to consider her options precipitates the most sustained rift with Lorelai to date, beginning in the season five finale. She moves into her grandparents\\' pool house, joins Emily’s branch of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and begins working for the organization. Rory and Lorelai barely speak for months and are only reconciled mid-season six, in \"The Prodigal Daughter Returns.\"\\r\\nExperiencing some problems with the restricted liberty of living with her grandparents, chiefly centering on her sexual relationship with Logan, Rory reassesses her life after another unexpected visit from Jess. He has achieved something with his own life by writing a novel and he encourages her to see that her current choices do not suit who she really is. However, Jess’s visit and Rory’s subsequent realization that she is doing nothing with her life precipitate an argument with Logan and the couple are estranged for some time. Rory doggedly pursues her former editor for a job at the Stamford Eagle Gazette, takes on extra courses at Yale to make up for her time away, and is unexpectedly elected editor of the Yale Daily News, taking over from Paris.\\r\\nRory and Logan reunite and cement their relationship despite his post-graduation spell working in London, England, and a failed business. She cultivates new friendships with girls involved in the arts and drama, Olivia and Lucy, although these relationships become fraught when Marty, a friend who had a crush on Rory in an earlier season, is revealed to be Lucy’s boyfriend. Having been unexpectedly elected editor of the Yale Daily News, Rory’s tenure later comes to an end and leaves her feeling deflated. She continues to work towards her goal, applying for the Reston Fellowship, to become an intern at The New York Times, as well as applying and interviewing for other jobs. She turns down one firm job offer, counting on getting the Reston Fellowship. When she is rejected, Rory is in turmoil, unable to concentrate on a final exam about John Milton’s epic poem, Paradise Lost, and generally experiencing great uncertainty about her future.\\r\\nAt Rory’s own graduation party, where it is revealed she graduated with honors and membership in Phi Beta Kappa, Logan unexpectedly proposes marriage and asks her to move to Palo Alto, California, with him. She considers his offer but ultimately declines, suggesting they try to maintain a long-distance relationship. She says that she relishes the openness of her life and the opportunities before her: marriage now would limit that. Logan, however, finds the prospect of \"going backwards\" in their relationship unappealing and issues the ultimatum that it is \"all or nothing.\" Rory wordlessly returns his engagement ring and Logan walks away. As of the final episode, Rory had prepared numerous résumés to mail before going on vacation with her mother. When another reporter drops out at the last moment, she is offered a job as a reporter for an online magazine, covering Barack Obama\\'s presidential campaign and his bid for the Democratic Party nomination. Luke throws a surprise graduation party for Rory, which closes out the series.\\r\\nNine years later, Rory is in a rut.  She has become a successful freelance journalist, but was fired from a job to ghostwrite a book, and gave up her apartment to stay in different places like New York, London, and Stars Hollow. She has been dating a man named Paul for two years, but does not seem to be invested in their relationship. After breaking up with Paul, she also engages in casual sex, including with a nameless man in a Wookie costume.\\r\\nWhile jetting back and forth between America and London, Rory sees Logan on the side. He, in turn, cheats on his fiancée with Rory, but he will not leave her for Rory. Rory interviews for many more jobs, but she does not receive any promising offers. Rory ends back in Stars Hollow and becomes the editor of the Stars Hollow Gazette. While at work one day, Jess visits her and gives her the idea of writing a book about her life and relationship with her mother, Lorelai.\\r\\nRory and her mother have a falling out when Rory tells Lorelai about the book, as Lorelai does not want her life written about. Rory continues to wander, although very determined to write her novel. She breaks things off with Logan for good, believing their relationship is not what is best for her. She ends up reconciling with her mother and is present when Lorelai marries Luke. Rory later reveals to Lorelai that she is pregnant. While the father\\'s identity is not explicitly stated, the timing implies that it is Logan\\'s child.\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment\\r\\nCasting and creation\\r\\nAlexis Bledel had no previous professional acting experience: \"It was just one of those young, beautiful faces. We were trying to find someone new, someone interesting. There was something about her. In person she was very shy and quiet, not this vivacious energy, just very simple and pretty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSusanne Daniels who oversaw the development of Gilmore Girls said: \"Amy wanted to write a smart teenage girl character who wasn\\'t a bombshell, or a mousy loner yearning for a Prince Charming to come break her out of her shell. Amy had in mind a girl with real complexity—a kid who was fiercely independent and intellectually precocious but naïve in matters of the heart.\" Amy Sherman-Palladino said: What to me had not been done was a girl who wasn\\'t fucking around at 14. A girl who was not interested in boys, not because of an aversion to boys, but who just was academically goal-oriented and really that\\'s what made her tick. And a girl who was very comfortable in her skin. Didn\\'t need to be popular, wasn\\'t popular, but didn\\'t care. Didn\\'t look longingly at the group over by the soda fountain with the good shoes. Because she had her best friend, her mom, and she had her other friend, and she had her life. And her life is good.\\r\\nEdward Herrmann who portrayed Rory\\'s grandfather Richard, said of his relationship with Rory: \"I think that was Amy\\'s idea from the beginning, to have this relationship between the grandfather and the granddaughter blossom. Which was very hard on the daughter to see, this unaffected affection expressed between her father and her daughter. That was a lovely element in the show that I really enjoyed.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacterization\\r\\nMargaret Lyons of Vulture.com wrote \"Rory\\'s worst attribute, other than her slouchy posture, is her lack of impulse control. Rory\\'s strongest motivator is want — if she wants to do it, she does. Her wants always win. Conveniently for her, her wants often align with social norms for WASP success, but on the occasions that they don\\'t, she still follows them. \"\\r\\nAlexis Bledel said of her character\\'s evolution up to the fifth season finale: \"Rory has been on a very specific path for most of her young life, so last season [season 4] was the year that sort of opened her eyes to the fact that there are so many other things. She realized how competitive the field she was trying to get into is, and how slim her chances actually were, and how hard she\\'d have to work ... when she already was working hard. We saw more about her than her academic goals, and it was fun to see where it would go. Viewers had never really seen [Rory] mess up too much. She was almost annoyingly perfect. You just never saw her do anything normal teenagers do, and Amy said when Rory messes up, it\\'s big.\"\\r\\nDescribed as \"a bright, well-behaved, pop-culturally savvy teenager\", Jezebel further called her a \"feminist\" for reading feminist prose, dreaming of having a career like Christiane Amanpour and for rejecting a wedding proposal because she is too young. Reflecting on Rory\\'s decision to turn down Logan\\'s proposal, Matt Czuchry said: \"I feel that the show is about two strong independent women, and that refusal captures the heart of the show. And I don\\'t think it was personal to Logan. I just think it was the right decision for Rory regardless of who her boyfriend was.\"\\r\\nCommenting on Rory\\'s friendship with Paris, Sherman-Palladino said: \"She needs challenges, and Paris is relentless. Rory will want to stay close to that kind of person because it keeps her sharp, her eyes focused on the prize.\" She liked the contrast of personalities, \"Rory\\'s complete acceptance of people for who they are\" and Paris\\'s unwillingness \"to accept anyone, even herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReception\\r\\nAfter watching the pilot of the series, Ron Wertheimer of The New York Times wrote: \"Ms. Bledel, new to television, creates an appealing blend of precocious wisdom and teenage anxiety.\" Variety critic Laura Fries called Bledel \"the real star\" for her ability \"to articulate the wide range of often subtle emotions that confront teenagers.\" In his article discussing child actors playing \"more meaningful characters\", Allan Johnson of the Chicago Tribune cited Bledel as one of \"two more young people who are showing some depth in their various portrayals\". Shirly Li of The Atlantic praised the friendship between Rory and Paris, describing it as \"a deep platonic female relationship that didn\\'t come prepackaged, but instead developed in front of viewers\\' eyes. [Their friendship] should be remembered as a cultural landmark—TV’s last, great, gradually developed friendship between teenage girls...Gilmore Girls offered something that’s rare on TV but common in real life.\\r\\nFor her portrayal of Rory Gilmore, Alexis Bledel won a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Drama Series - Leading Young Actress in 2001. She was nominated in the same category in 2002. In the same year, Bledel won a Family Television Award for Best Actress. She also earned a Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress Comedy in 2005 and in 2006. Bledel further received nominations from several organizations including the Online Film & Television Association Awards for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2002, the Saturn Awards and Satellite Awards in 2003, and the ALMA Awards in 2006.\\r\\n\\r\\nRory Gilmore’s Controversial Moments\\r\\nRory Gilmore, initially introduced as an ambitious and morally upright teenager in \"Gilmore Girls,\" experiences a series of controversial moments that mark her drastic character transformation. Her affair with married ex-boyfriend Dean Forester and her cruel body-shaming remarks, such as the “Die, Jerk” incident, illustrate her moral lapses and growing entitlement. The shift in Rory\\'s character, particularly during her college years at Yale, highlights a departure from the diligent, relatable girl-next-door to a more flawed and less likable individual, sparking ongoing debate among fans about her journey and development throughout the series.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\"All 408 Books In Rory Gilmore\\'s Reading List\". Epic Reads (epicreads.com).', 'Ricardo Breceda is an artist most well known for his large metal sculptures of animals. He was born in the town of Villa Unión in the state of Durango, Mexico, but now resides in Aguanga, California. He is unmarried and has two daughters, Lianna and Arabi. He originally worked as a cowboy boots salesman and a construction worker, but a construction accident caused him to leave the latter job. He made a metal sculpture of a Tyrannosaurus rex for his daughter Lianna after she asked for a dinosaur for Christmas following a viewing of Jurassic Park III.\\r\\nHe continued work on sculptures, and was eventually discovered by a philanthropist named Dennis Avery who paid him to construct one piece. Avery then allowed Breceda to build more than 100 sculptures on his property at Galleta Meadows Estate. The sculptures are based on beasts found in a book that depicts now-fossilized creatures in the Anza Borrego Desert as well as mythological creatures. Notable statues made by Breceda include a stagecoach pulled by horses, a large serpent, and a Tyrannosaurus rex.\\r\\nBreceda was the subject of a book called \"Ricardo Breceda: Accidental Artist\", and his art was cited by both The Huffington Post and The San Diego Union-Tribune as reasons why people should visit the Anza-Borrego Desert. His outdoor studio location, known for its rustic charm and open landscape, is located on Highway 79 in Aguanga, California. It is accessible to the public as a space to view the variety and scale of the artwork as well as purchase it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nRicardo Breceda was born in Durango, Mexico. He is a single parent to his daughter. He later moved to Borrego Springs, California.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nBreceda worked as a cowboy boots salesman in Durango, among other professions. He also worked as a construction worker, but suffered a construction accident and was injured. His inspiration for the statues came when he brought his then 6-year-old daughter to see the film Jurassic Park III in 2001. After the movie, he asked his daughter what she wanted for Christmas, and she replied that she wanted a dinosaur. A few weeks later, Breceda made his first metal statue, which was a 20-foot tall, 45-foot long Tyrannosaurus rex, for his daughter. This led to him to make more of these statues as a hobby, and eventually people began to show interest and offered to purchase some of his statues. In 2007, a philanthropist named Dennis Avery drove by his studio, then located in Perris, California. Avery asked Breceda to create statues on his property based on beasts featured in a book he financed about now-fossilized creatures once found in the Anza-Borrego Desert. Avery continued to request that Breceda create more of the beasts found in the book until he ran out of animals for Breceda to recreate. Once this happened, Breceda began work on statues based on mythical creatures. When Avery died in 2012, a fund was established to ensure that if storms or vandals damaged his statues, he would be able to repair them. By the time Avery had died, Breceda had finished 130 of the sculptures requested of him by Avery. The sculptures contributed to an increase in economic prosperity in Borrego Springs, which suffered from the Great Recession. He eventually moved to Borrego Springs. His metal works studio is found on Highway 79 just outside of  Aguanga, California near the Anza Borrego Desert.\\r\\nHow Breceda became involved in making metal statues caused him to be called \"The Accidental Artist.\" as well as \"the Picasso of Steel\". His sculptures generally sell anywhere between $100 and $700 and up. According to Breceda, he is a self-taught metal works artist. Some of Breceda\\'s sculptures include a stagecoach pulled by horses, a bear, and a scorpion. Breceda also makes statues of people, most of which are based on people from the old west (such as cowboys) and Native American figures. One of Breceda\\'s most notable sculptures is a 350-foot serpent found in Borrego Springs whose head and body pops out of the sand. Other notable examples of Breceda\\'s work includes fighting dinosaur statues and a series of wild horse sculptures as seen from Highway 79. His daughter assists in the sculpting of his statues.\\r\\nBreceda hosted an Open House Art and Music Festival at his studio in the Vail Lake Resort RV Park. The event played host to more than 20 local artists, and in addition to selling their art, these artists were also creating art at the event. The artists at the event include airbrush specialists, oil painters, canvas painters, chalk art, face painters and body painters. The event featured live music from bands, such as SantanaWays.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecognition\\r\\nAccording to Borrego Springs\\' Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Linda Haddock, the town receives thousands of visitors who come to see his art, and four out of five people who haven\\'t been to the town before who visit the Chamber of Commerce office are looking to see his art. A biography about Ricardo Breceda and his art work was written by biographer and historian Diana Lindsay. The book covers his early years as an artist, how he came to get into it, and other aspects of his life and career. Breceda\\'s sculptures were featured in a list of the 11 best art spots in Southern California outside of Los Angeles written by Priscilla Frank for The Huffington Post. The Anza-Borrego Desert was named as The San Diego Union-Tribune\\'s fifth favorite state park, and used a picture of Breceda\\'s serpent sculpture. Another article written by Carolina Gusman for The San Diego Union-Tribune recommended the Anza-Borrego Desert for people looking for a vacation that\\'s low budget due in part to Breceda\\'s sculptures. Alta Vista Botanical Gardens in Vista, California has acquired nine of Ricardo Breceda\\'s sculptures, including a large five-piece serpent sculpture, which have been installed in various locations throughout the Gardens.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nOfficial website\\r\\nLocation of working Sculpture garden', \"Stephan Abel Sinding (4 August 1846 � 23 January 1922) was a Norwegian-Danish sculptor. He moved to Copenhagen in 1883 and had his breakthrough the same year. In 1890 he obtained Danish citizenship. In 1910 he settled in Paris where he lived and worked until his death in 1922.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and education\\r\\nStephan Abel Sinding was born in Trondhjem as a son of mining engineer  Matthias Wilhelm Sinding (1811�1860) and Cecilie Marie Mejdell (1817�1886). Sinding was the brother of the composer Christian Sinding and painter Otto Ludvig Sinding and the nephew of Nicolai Mejdell (1822�1899) and Thorvald Mejdell (1824�1908), and through the former a first cousin of Gl�r Thorvald Mejdell, who married Stephan's sister Thora Cathrine Sinding. Stephan Sinding was also a first cousin of Alfred Sinding-Larsen and the three siblings Ernst Anton Henrik Sinding, Elisabeth Sinding (1846�1930) and Gustav Adolf Sinding      (1849�1925).\\r\\nSinding first embarked on law studies in Christiania but broke off to instead pursue a career in the arts. He took drawing and modeling classes first at the Royal School of Drawing in Christiania and then studied privately with sculptor Albert Wolff in Berlin. Sinding spent his adult life working in different places mostly Rome, Copenhagen, and finally Paris. \\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 1874 to 1875 he  studied in Paris and picked up influences from the latest Realist tendencies in French sculptures, especially from Auguste Rodin and Paul Dubois.  Sinding was met with poor recognition from the Norwegian public since his style was considered too modern.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer in Denmark\\r\\nIn 1883 he moved to Copenhagen, which he found a better working place, and had his breakthrough with the sculpture A barbarian woman carries her dead son home from the battle, created during a stay in Rome that same year. It was acquired by the brewer Carl Jacobsen, the son and heir of Carlsberg-founder Jacob Christian Jacobsen, who was a great admirer of both classical and modern sculpture and was building an ever-growing private collection which in the end turned into the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek\\r\\nSinding created a number of sculptures, among others Mother in Captivity, which won him the Grand Prix at the Exposition Universelle (1889),  Two figures (1889), and Young woman at her husband's body / The Widow (1892). Many of Sinding's sculptures are credited to realism, but together with Danish sculptor Niels Hansen Jacobsen, among others, are by many considered much more in the style of Symbolism. An example of his symbolic work is his sculpture Valkyrjen (the valkyrie), a bronze cast of which stands in Churchill Park in Copenhagen.\\r\\nSinding became a titular professor and taught private students in Copenhagen.\\r\\n\\r\\nLate years in Paris\\r\\nIn 1910 Sinding moved to Paris, where he worked until his death. Assisted by Franz von Jessen, Sinding wrote an autobiography entitled En Billedhuggers Liv (1921). He died in January 1922 in Paris, and was buried at the P�re Lachaise Cemetery.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrivate life\\r\\nIn May 1885 in Frederiksberg he married actress Anna Elga Augusta Betzonich (1859�1936).\\r\\n\\r\\nSelected works\\r\\nV�lund smed, 1873\\r\\nHylas, ca. 1880\\r\\nSlaven, 1878,\\r\\nFrise, 1891\\r\\nEnken, 1892\\r\\nHenrik Ibsen, 1899\\r\\nBj�rnstjerne Bj�rnson, 1899\\r\\nModer Jord, 1900\\r\\nOle Bull, 1901\\r\\nValkyrjen, 1908\\r\\nAngelus, 1913\\r\\nL'Offrande, 1918\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nOther sources\\r\\nGrappe,  Georges Stephan Sinding (Paris: Librairie Artistique Internationale. 1920)\\r\\nRapsilber, M.

NHK WORLD. Retrieved 1 June 2021.', 'Cynthia \"Cindy\" Campbell is a fictional character from the Scary Movie franchise. Portrayed by Anna Faris and created by Shawn Wayans, Marlon Wayans, Buddy Johnson, Phil Beauman, Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the character first appeared as a high school student in Scary Movie (2000). In the film, whose main parodies are the Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer franchises, Cindy shares a role similar to Sidney Prescott and Julie James.\\r\\nFaris would reprise her role of Cindy in the film\\'s sequels. In Scary Movie 2, Cindy is attending college and with her friends, goes to Hell House for Professor Oldman\\'s experiment. Here, her role is based on Eleanor Vance from The Haunting. In Scary Movie 3, where her role is based on Rachel Keller from The Ring, she is portrayed as a news presenter and has a nephew, Cody. After seeing a cursed tape, she tries to break the curse before seven days pass and she dies. In Scary Movie 4, where she parodies Karen Davis from The Grudge, Cindy is working as a caregiver in a haunted house and attempts to stop an alien attack with the help of Brenda.\\r\\nUp until the fourth installment, Faris and Regina Hall, who portrayed Brenda Meeks, were the only cast members to appear in every installment of the franchise. Faris did not return for Scary Movie 5 and Cindy was replaced by Ashley Tisdale\\'s character, Jody Sanders. Faris, herself, poked fun at her character\\'s absence in the 2016 film Keanu where she explains that she only appeared in the first four Scary Movie films, not the fifth because she was \"too old\".\\r\\nCritical response to Faris\\' portrayal has been positive.\\r\\n\\r\\nCharacter\\r\\nPersonality\\r\\nCindy is a sweet and cheerful character, and soft-spoken and meek at first glance. Originally brunette, becoming blonde later, she is very caring for others, such as striving to protect people like Cody or even the rest of the world from watching the horror tape. She also shows an interest in animal rights advocacy, as well as helping the homeless and protecting the environment. She matures from a clueless teenager to a much tougher and motherly woman, although she is at times unclever or tactless. She is slightly insecure, especially when others comment on her appearance.\\r\\nHowever, Cindy does have a more hostile side, even when she was a teenager, shown when she punched Gail Hailstorm in the face for telling her that her \"ass looks fat.\" Cindy also has a rather unfortunate track record when it comes to relationships, her first boyfriend, Bobby Prinze, constantly tried to pressure her into being intimate with him and was later revealed to be both gay and a murderer who later attempted to kill her. Her next love interest, Buddy was also rather argumentative and their relationship presumably did not last. Her first marriage to an aggressive and disrespectful man turned out to be quite opprobrious and abusive, resulting in a divorce. Her most successful relationship was with her second husband George Logan, but he later died during a boxing accident.\\r\\nShe is shown to be a good fighter at several moments in her life, employing martial arts skills similar to the fight skills in The Matrix. She sometimes has brief moments of extraordinary strength, once lifting CJ off his feet out of frustration.\\r\\nShe can also speak a form of \"Mock Japanese,\" which Toshio remarks as terrible as it is just words such as Mitsubishi, Samurai, and Fujitsu thrown together.\\r\\nShe has displayed engineering skills, where after being locked in a walk-in freezer, she escapes by building a functioning Caterpillar 2-Ton tractor out of random things in the freezer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamily and friends\\r\\nThe only people in Cindy\\'s family who have appeared in the movies or are mentioned are her father (reportedly a drug dealer), her unnamed sister, a grandmother and her nephew, Cody Campbell. Both the Sheriff and Principal Squiggman allude to Cindy\\'s mother having been sexually promiscuous. Cindy has been married twice, once with an unknown man and later to George Logan who dies in between 2003 and 2006. Her brother-in-law was Tom Logan. She was last known to be in a relationship with Tom Ryan.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecurring gags\\r\\nCindy is one of the few characters to have a running gag about her; the only other character being Ray. This gag revolves around her thin frame, particularly in how she is not as busty as Brenda Meeks or Buffy Gilmore. When she flashes Bobby in the first film, she is shown to have a masculine torso with gross traits such as a hairy chest with flabby breasts, the ugly sight of her being topless causes him to fall out of the window. While in the first sequel, her fellow college friends are much more shallow and bullying when they compare her figure to Caroline Kane in her portrait. Buddy also calls her \"A-cup\" after he punches her, and Shorty Meeks comments that her breasts are orangutan-like while the group gazes over Caroline\\'s portrait. While in the third film, Cindy who is now an attractive reporter, once tried to prove a point while arguing about breast augmentation by revealing to her boss and co-workers her now enlarged \"twins\", which they appear to be more bigger and more natural than Becka Kotler\\'s silicone implants and features a \"sloshing\" sound of lactation when jiggled, Cindy also wears tight tops to prevent the distraction of males to the point where they throw a wild party, even at her own job. Cindy even excites men whenever she hugs them, such as the brief moment where her boyfriend George Logan pointed out that she is pressing up against him. In the fourth film, a hand was seen trying to touch her chest like what Buddy once did in the second film. In both the third and fourth films, Cindy\\'s new breasts are not obvious unless she flashes her chest on-camera; it has also never been implied that Cindy\\'s enlarged bra size was done out of surgery, this sexualized trait is only a retcon along with her blonde hair.\\r\\nAnother brief running gag in the first two movies is during overexaggerated sex-scenes with Cindy. Such as when she finally goes to \"the next level\" with Bobby in the first movie where she performs the \"cowgirl\" position on Bobby, which ends with him ejaculating a fountain of semen so strong, that Cindy blasted to the ceiling, and Bobby looks like an emaciated husk of himself. In the sequel, Buddy who is on the brink of freezing to death from after the paranormal activity traps them in the cooler, he cons Cindy who is tasked to keep him warm, by giving him a \"hand\" which causes him to produce a fire-hydrant of semen that covers half the room while blasting Cindy against the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nAppearances\\r\\nScary Movie\\r\\nCindy is a high school student attending B. A. Corpse High School with her boyfriend Bobby Prinze. Their friends include Brenda Meeks, Buffy Gilmore, Ray Wilkins and Greg Phillipe. Despite being in a committed relationship with Bobby, the two of them still have not consummated their relationship. Following Drew Decker\\'s death, it is revealed that one year prior, the six of them had accidentally ran over a man while drinking. While the man was unharmed, they did not notice and after accidentally knocking him unconscious, dumped his body at a pier. Later the same day, she notices Ghostface outside her classroom and a note on her desk telling her that \"they know what she did last Halloween\". After being attacked by Ghostface, she assumes that Bobby is the killer and gets him arrested. After the real killer calls her, she decides to invite her friends to keep each other safe. Thanks to Shorty, the small get-together turns into a party. After having sex with Bobby, it is revealed that he is gay and in a relationship with Ray. Despite killing Shorty, they reveal to her that they are copycats of the real killer who appears and kills both of them. After knocking him out, Cindy is taken to the police station where she realizes Doofy, Buffy\\'s brother, is the killer. Despite running after him, Doofy manages to escape, leaving Cindy screaming in the middle of the street, only to get ran over by a car.\\r\\n\\r\\nScary Movie 2\\r\\nOne year after the events of the previous film, Cindy is attending college with Brenda, Shorty and Ray, despite all three of them having died in the previous film and the latter having tried to kill her.\\r\\n\\r\\nScary Movie 3\\r\\nNow a journalist, Cindy has custody of her paranormally gifted nephew, Cody. She again meets Brenda, now a teacher. Unnerved, Brenda asks Cindy to stay with her for the night, when she says she watched a cursed tape. Brenda is murdered by a supernatural girl named Tabitha after failing to turn off the TV. Cindy goes after the answer to the curse of the tape, discovering that aliens are also involved, all while trying to protect Cody and her new friends, Tom Logan, his daughter, and brother George, who becomes Cindy\\'s love interest. After breaking the curse, she marries George.\\r\\n\\r\\nScary Movie 4\\r\\nCindy has become broke and lonely because her husband George had died and her nephew Cody has enrolled in military academy.\\r\\nOver the following day, Cindy bonds with Tom Ryan, confiding to him about George\\'s death in a fateful boxing match. The two realize their newfound love, but are interrupted by a gigantic triPod which disables electricity and starts vaporizing the town residents.\\r\\nCindy converses in mock Japanese with the haunted house\\'s ghost, Toshio, learning that the answer of the invasion is his father\\'s heart. While Tom leaves the city with his children, Cindy reunites with her friend, Brenda Meeks, miraculously alive after her death (having been pieced back together by Mahalik). Following Toshio\\'s directions, the two head to the countryside and end up in a mysterious, isolated community. They are captured and put to trial headed by Henry Hale. The result allows them to live but never leave the village.\\r\\nTom and his children drive and find themselves in the middle of a war between the U.S. military and the aliens. Excited with the conflict, Robbie runs away, while Tom and Rachel are taken by the triPod. Back at the village, Henry is killed by the village loon, Ezekiel, revealing to Cindy that he fathered Toshio, who was killed during Cindy\\'s boxing match. Cindy and Brenda are soon taken by the triPod and sent to the bathroom seen in the prologue, and they get stuck into the Venus flytrap. Cindy manages to get through Billy\\'s challenge, but is threatened with the safety of Tom and his children, who are put to traps. Looking at a toilet with the \"heart\" nearby, Cindy realizes that Billy, through Henry\\'s wife, is the true father of Toshio. Seeing how far Tom would go to save his children, Billy apologizes for the invasion and releases them. Robbie and Rachel are successfully returned to their mother who is revealed to have married a much older man. Brenda also becomes romantically involved with Billy\\'s brother, Zoltar.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Tom appears in The Oprah Winfrey Show and wildly professes his love for Cindy by jumping around, throwing Cindy, and crushing Oprah\\'s wrists and hitting her with a chair.\\r\\n\\r\\nDevelopment\\r\\nParody and inspiration\\r\\nIn Scary Movie, Cindy is a parody of Sidney Prescott from Scream and Julie James from I Know What You Did Last Summer. Her first name is a play on Sidney, while her last name is taken from Neve Campbell, who portrayed Sidney in the Scream franchise.\\r\\n\\r\\nCasting and portrayal\\r\\nIn an interview with People, it was revealed that Anna Faris beat out about hundreds of actresses who auditioned for the role of Cindy. Keenen Ivory Wayans, director of the first two films, said about Faris that \"there was a great freshness about her, because [she] had nothing to lose. She didn\\'t think in a million years she was going to get the part\".\\r\\nFaris revealed that Scary Movie was her first Hollywood audition and that she highly enjoyed working on the franchise as it allowed her to be funny, feeling that female characters are not often allowed to be funny in films. Additionally, she stated that one of the things she liked about the franchise is that \"[they] can spoof whatever [they want,] take what\\'s popular at the moment and slide it into a very complicated plot structure\".\\r\\n\\r\\nReception\\r\\nCritical response\\r\\nBruce G. Hallenbeck, in his book Comedy-Horror Films: A Chronological History, 1914–2008, described Faris as \"the real discovery of Scary Movie, the one performer who tries valiantly to hold everything together\".\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==', 'William Wellington Gqoba (August 1840 – 26 April 1888) was a South African Xhosa poet, translator, and  journalist.

The Historical Records of the 24th foot and of the 40th foot (2nd Somersetshire regiment, now 1st battalion the Prince of Wales\\'s volunteers)—the former published in 1892 and the latter in 1893—owe much to his labours, and at the time of his death he was beginning work on the records of his own regiment, the 80th foot. \\r\\nIn 1890, he edited The Memoirs of the Extraordinary Military Career of John Shipp in Mr. Fisher Unwin\\'s Adventure Series. \\r\\nHe collaborated with George Burges-Short in preparing The Records and Badges of every Regiment and Corps in the British Army, which was published in 1895, the year following Chichester\\'s death. \\r\\nProbably Chichester\\'s most important contributions to military history appeared in this dictionary, for which he wrote memoirs of 499 military officers or writers on military subjects. \\r\\nHis name figured in the list of writers prefixed to each volume from the first to the forty-sixth (omitting the forty-fifth). \\r\\nAmong the more conspicuous military names entrusted to him were Lords Cadogan and Cutts, Viscount Hardinge of Lahore, Rowland, first Viscount Hill, Lord Lynedoch, Stringer Lawrence, and Sir John Moore. \\r\\nHe was indefatigable in his efforts to collect authentic biograpliic details. \\r\\nHis method of work is well illustrated by his notice of Francis Jarry, a Frenchman who founded the Royal Military College now located at Sandhurst. \\r\\nIt was already known that Jarry in earlier life had served at various times in both the Prussian and French armies, but, in order to ascertain definitely his services abroad, Chichester applied to the ministries of war at both Paris and Berlin, and induced the authorities in both places to make investigation, of which the results appeared in the Dictionary.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorks\\r\\nMemoirs of the extraordinary military career of John Shipp, late a lieut. in His Majesty\\'s 87th regiment (1890) (as editor)\\r\\nThe Records and Badges of Every Regiment and Corps in the British Army (1900) with George Burges-Short\\r\\nChichester wrote over 480 entries for the Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nSources\\r\\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Lee, Sidney (1901). \"Chichester, Henry Manners\".

He was the leader of the so-called Old Slovene political movement. Already during his lifetime, he was called father of the nation.\\r\\nBleiweis was born in a wealthy merchant family in the Carniolan city of Kranj, then part of the Austrian Empire. Since childhood, he was raised in a bilingual environment. He was fluent in both Slovene and Austrian German, as most of the members of the upper middle class in Carniola at the time. He attended the lyceum in Ljubljana before enrolling at the University of Vienna, where he studied medicine. After completing his studies, he worked as a professor of veterinary medicine and pathology in Ljubljana. Bleiweis wrote a number of text from the fields of the veterinary medicine and human health, particularly about infectious diseases.\\r\\nIn 1843, Bleiweis founded the journal Kmetijske in rokodelske novice (Farmers\\' and Craftsmen\\'s News) and edited it until his death in 1881. It dealt with economic, as well as with cultural issues in the Slovene Lands. In the spring of nations of 1848, he became involved in politics and supported the quest of United Slovenia. At the beginning of the constitutional period in the Austrian Empire, Bleiweis emerged as the leader of the Slovene national movement. Already in the late 1850s, however, his politically conservatitive leadership was challenged by the younger generation of Slovene nationalists, known as the Young Slovenes, among whom were Fran Levstik, Josip Stritar, and Josip Jurčič. Bleiweis\\' group, which included Lovro Toman, Etbin Henrik Costa, Luka Svetec and Andrej Einspieler was identified as the Old Slovenes thereafter, although they themselves never accepted such a name.\\r\\nBleiweis was a Habsburg legitimist and follower of the Austroslavist ideology. In politics, he followed the example of the Czech leader František Palacký, who demanded autonomy for the Slavic peoples within a unified Austrian Empire.\\r\\nIn 1881, Bleiweis was granted knighthood by Franz Joseph I of Austria, the Emperor of Austria. The same year, he died in Ljubljana and was buried in the St. Christopher Cemetery in the Bežigrad district of Ljubljana.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nSources\\r\\nJože Pogačnik, \"Janez Bleiweis\" in Slovenska misel: eseji o slovenstvu (Ljubljana: Cankarjeva založba, 1987), 437-438\\r\\n\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\\r\\nJanez Bleiweis at Find a Grave', \"Juan José Calandria (December 12, 1902 – July 18, 1980) was a Uruguayan painter and sculptor.\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nEarly life\\r\\nCalandria was born on December 12, 1902, in Canelones, Uruguay.\\r\\nUpon graduating from school, he studied at the Escuela de Artes Decorativos and the Escuela Industrial in Montevideo with an architectural career in mind. He became so interested in sculpture, however, that he soon devoted his entire time to studies in that field.\\r\\nBy the time he was eighteen, Calandria had had a one-man show with ensuing honors and commissions. At this time, he also won the most important art scholarship offered in Uruguay—a four-year period of study abroad. When it was decided that he was too young to accept this honor, he was not discouraged. He continued his studies and won the award again when he was twenty-two. He won his first gold medal and the Grand Prize at the Exposición Agropecuria e Industrial in Canelones, Uruguay.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nAfter extensive travels in Europe, Calandria settled in Paris where he stayed for the next fourteen years, working under the guidance of Antoine Bourdelle, Charles Despiau and Marcel Gimond. He soon became Gimond's assistant at the Académie Colarassi and also held classes in his own studio. Calandria was awarded the gold medal at the 1937 Paris Exhibition, where several of his sculptures were on exhibit in the Uruguayan Pavilion. His work was well known and admired in the French capital by 1939, where he exhibited in many galleries, the Salon des Tuileries and Printemps, and the Exposition des Artistes Contemporains, the latter a great honor.\\r\\nWar was declared while Calandria was vacationing in Greece. He sailed at once for New York City, spending nearly a year there and exhibiting several times. Thereafter, he went back to Uruguay and in 1941 was appointed Consul to New Orleans. He was married that same year in New York to Challis Walker and moved to the south were the Calandrias have lived ever since.\\r\\nCalandria has exhibited his paintings and sculpture in North and South America and in Europe.\\r\\nWhen he retired from Consular duties in 1958, he was then free to give all of his time to his art, which flourished both in quality and success. At about the same time, his work became increasingly abstract and remained so during his lifetime.\\r\\nHe taught sculpture in Paris, drawing at the New Orleans Arts and Crafts Club in New Orleans during World War II, and held classes in painting and sculpture for adults and children in his Pontalba studio in the French Quarter. Later, he held classes in sculpture for several years in the Calandria School of Painting and Sculpture located at Gallier Hall and, thereafter, in his Jefferson Avenue studio. He also gave lectures and demonstrations in the New Orleans area.\\r\\nHis exhibition at the International Trade Mart was his last large and major exhibition. Plagued with arthritis, he nevertheless continued to work on his knees, as any other position was impossible. Forced to stop sculpture, he continued to paint prolifically and was more than prepared for another large one-man show. However, in 1978, a new illness set in. Another exhibition would have been too difficult and during the last two years of his life, he stopped painting altogether. He died on July 18, 1980.\\r\\nHe was the first New Orleans artist to have his work, in this case a sculpture, purchased for the New Orleans Museum of Art's permanent collection.\\r\\nThis biography was written by Challis Walker Calandria, the wife of Juan Jose Calandria, and provided to Wikipedia by his son Andres Calandria.\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\n\\r\\nCalandria Fine Art\", 'El Anatsui (; born 4 February 1944) is a Ghanaian sculptor active for much of his career in Nigeria. He has drawn particular international attention for his \"bottle-top installations\". These installations consist of thousands of aluminum pieces sourced from alcohol recycling stations and sewn together with copper wire, which are then transformed into metallic cloth-like wall sculptures. Such materials, while seemingly stiff and sturdy, are actually free and flexible, which often helps with manipulation when installing his sculptures. \\r\\nAnatsui was included in the 2023 Time 100 list of the world\\'s most influential people.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarly life and education\\r\\nEl Anatsui was  born in Anyako, in the Volta Region of Ghana. The youngest of his father\\'s 32 children, Anatsui lost his mother and was raised by his uncle. His first experience with art was through drawing letters on a chalkboard. His lettering attempts drew the attention of his school\\'s headmaster, who encouraged his effort by providing him with more chalk. Because of his age at the time (just after kindergarten), he regarded the letters more as images than as letters--the forms interested him.\\r\\nAnatsui received his B.A in 1968 from the College of Art and Built Environment (KNUST) in Kumasi, Ghana. He received his postgraduate diploma in Art Education the following year, in 1969, from Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), also in Kumasi.\\r\\nSome of his early artistic influences include Oku Ampofo, Vincent Akwete Kofi, and Kofi Antubam, all of whom began to reject foreign influences in their practices in favor of indigenous art forms. After graduating in 1969, Anatsui assumed a teaching position at Winneba Specialist Training College (now University of Education), a role that had previously been filled by Kofi.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe began teaching at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka in 1975. He became a senior lecturer for the Fine and Applied Arts department in 1982, and later became head of that department and full professor of sculpture in 1996, a role he occupied until 2011. His presence at the University of Nsukka led to his affiliation with the Nsukka group.It has taken many years to find artists who can occupy a prominent place on the global circuit while choosing to reside outside the metropolitan centres. William Kentridge has made his reputation from Johannesburg, and El Anatsui has conquered the planet while living and working in the Nigerian university town of Nsukka.\\r\\n\\r\\nArtwork\\r\\nAnatsui notes that, through school and in university, \"everything we were doing was western,\" especially within the fine arts department of his university; he felt that there was something missing in his education for its lack of focus on his own culture. In order to rectify this, he started visiting the National Cultural Centre of Ghana, also in Kumasi, to engage with the musicians, graphic artists, textile artists, printers, and creative artists of all types. It was there that he encountered Adinkra, a system of signs and symbols, which was his first introduction to abstract art and opened up a new world of artistic possibilities for him.\\r\\nIn the 1970s, Anatsui worked frequently in wood. He was particularly interested in wooden trays, which he often saw used in the markets to display food items and other wares--he would carve them or engrave them with Adinkra symbols and other marks using hot rods. He also began using wood to construct wall panels from strips placed next to each other, the surface decorated with designs imparted on the material through the use of chain saws, gouges, flame, or paint.  In the late 70s, he began working in clay: pots, in particular, exploring themes of fragility and dilapidation. He was interested in how, even after a pot breaks and ceases being used in the way we commonly think (for food, water), it takes on a new purpose, even acquires more uses, from the mundane to the spiritual. Most intriguing to him is the use of pot shards for presenting offerings. He said, \"It\\'s as if the pot, having broken, is transformed into a dimension which makes it ideal for use by ancestors and deities who are themselves in the spirit dimension.\"\\r\\nAfter his work with the broken pots, Anatsui explored food-adjacent themes in other materials: wood, again, in the form of mortars; equipment used to process cassava, and bottle tops.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch of Anatsui\\'s work features found materials, or materials that had a life of use prior to being formed into this artworks. His emphasis on the found object, however, is less Duchampian, and more focused on the history of use and the evidence of the human hand in the material. \"When something has been used, there is a certain charge, a certain energy, that has to do with the people who have touched it and used it and sometimes abused it. This helps to direct what one is doing, and also to root what one is doing in the environment and the culture.\"Metal bottle caps are a favorite material of his; like cloth, Anatsui describes, an arrangement of bottle caps is versatile, allowing him to consider his art both sculpturally (through the form of the caps) and in a painterly manner (through the colors of the caps). Further, he appreciates the glimpse that bottle caps give into current and historical political and sociological issues, by virtue of the names and colors of various drink brands that are printed onto the caps.\"The most important thing for me is the transformation. The fact that  these media, each identifying a brand of drink, are no longer going back to serve the same role but are elements that could generate some reflection, some thinking, or just some wonder. This is possible because they are removed from their accustomed, functional context into a new one, and they bring along their histories and identities.\"A number of themes are present in Anatsui\\'s work: the destruction and subsequent reconstitution of material as a metaphor for life and the changes Africa faced under colonialism and since independence; traditional themes and motifs of West African strip woven cloth and other African textiles; and concern over Western scholarly misinterpretation of African history and the distortions it has caused. His work is also thematically connected to the West African cultural landscape and ideas of consumption and labor.\\r\\nThe idea of Sankofa [translated as \"go back and retrieve\"] is also present in Anatsui\\'s work. He views it as a way of drawing on the past, the lessons it offers, to chart a mode of moving forward. For him, Sankofa described a need to draw from what was immediately around him; Ghana became independent when he was in high school, and much of his education had been focused on western art and art history, and so he felt called to \\'go back and retrieve\\' aspects of Ghanaian culture that had been suppressed, something he described as a sort of \"quest for self-discovery.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nExhibitions\\r\\nAnatsui\\'s career grew gradually, starting in his home village of Nsukka before branching off to places such as Enugu and Lagos, and eventually internationally. In 1990, Anatsui had his first important group show at the Studio Museum In Harlem, New York. He also was one of three artists singled out in the 1990 exhibition \"Contemporary African Artists: Changing Traditions\", which was extended for five years.\\r\\nAnatsui has since exhibited his work around the world, including at the Brooklyn Museum (2013); the Clark Art Institute (2011); the Rice University Art Gallery, Houston (2010); the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (2008–09); the National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C. (2008); the Fowler Museum at UCLA (2007); the Venice Biennale (1990 and 2007); the Hayward Gallery (2005); the Liverpool Biennial (2002); the National Museum of African Art (2001); the Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona (2001); the 8th Osaka Sculpture Triennale (1995); the 5th Gwangju Biennale (2004); the Arab Museum of Modern Art in Doha (2019); and the Kunstmuseum Bern (2020).\\r\\nIn 1995, Anatsui held his first solo exhibition outside of Africa in London. He expressed a variety of themes and demonstrated how African art can be shown in a multitude of ways that are not seen as \"typical\" African. His work utilized conceptual modes used by European and American artists but hardly in African countries. Anatsui showed his work at the de Young Museum in San Francisco in 2005. This was his first time \"appear[ing] as part of the permanent collection in a major art museum\". Also in 2005, his exhibition at New York\\'s Skoto Gallery, \"Danudo,\" was the first display of his metal sheets in an American city. At this gallery, Skoto Aghahowa presented Anatsui\\'s wood wall panels alongside Sol LeWitt\\'s drawings. This exhibition popularized his bottle-cap works as he gained more recognition in the press.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnatsui was invited to the Venice Biennale in 2006 and again in 2007 where he was commissioned to make two hanging metal tapestries. During the 2007 edition, he exhibited his works at the Palazzo Fortuny which consisted of newly built walls for him to display three metal hangings entitled Dusasa. Each artwork demonstrated different textures and colors including golds, reds, and blacks. The way the bottle tops draped throughout the hangings created a sense of gentleness that made it stand apart from the other works in the gallery. The art curator of the Biennale, Robert Storr, mentions that the artist\\'s series \"reaches back into a whole series of things in the postwar period-it has a kind of exaltation I have not seen before\". During this Venetian showing, Anatsui wanted to create a new experience for his viewers conceptually. He believes that \"human life is not something which is cut and dried. It is something that is constantly in a state of change.\" At this point, he began to refer his metalworks as hangings instead of \"cloths\".\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2010 retrospective of his work, entitled When I Last Wrote to You About Africa, was organized by the Museum for African Art and opened at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It subsequently toured venues in the United States for three years, concluding at the University of Michigan Museum of Art.\\r\\nA major exhibition of recent works, entitled Gravity & Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui, had its New York premiere at the Brooklyn Museum in 2013. Organized by the Akron Art Museum (exhibition: 2012), the exhibition later traveled to the Des Moines Art Center (2013–14) and the Bass Museum of Art in Miami (2014).\\r\\nA career-spanning survey of his work, organized by Okwui Enwezor and Chika Okeke-Agulu, entitled Triumphant Scale drew record-breaking crowds when it opened, in March 2019 at Munich\\'s Haus der Kunst. From there, the show travelled to the Arab Museum of Modern Art, in Doha, and later to the Kunstmuseum Bern in 2020.\\r\\nAnatsui was selected for the 2023 Hyundai Commission at the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern; a vast display space for large-scale sculptural and site-specific artworks. His work, \"Behind the Red Moon,\" is made of thousands of metal bottle tops and fragments, building upon his work with materials linked to the transatlantic slave trade, and will be on view through April 14, 2024.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther activities\\r\\nAnatsui was selected to be a member of the International Society for Education through Art (InSEA) world council in 1992 for his work in education. Anatsui was a founding member and fellow of the Forum for African Arts in 2000. That year he also became a member of the International Selection Committee for the Dakar Biennale in Senegal. In 2001 he was a fellow at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Italy.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecognition\\r\\nAwards\\r\\nAnatsui won an honorable mention at the First Ghana National Art Competition as an undergraduate student in 1968. The following year he was awarded the Best Student of the Year at the College of Art in Kumasi, Ghana. In 1983 he won a commission for two large public sculptures made of terrazzo-surfaced cement on the Nsukka campus. He was selected to be one of ten artists invited to the Zweites Symposium Nordesekkuste residency in Cuxhaven, West Germany, in 1984.\\r\\nIn 1990, Anatsui was invited to the 44th annual Venice Biennale show 5 Contemporary African Artists, where he received an honorable mention. That year he was included in the American documentary Nigerian Art-Kindred Spirits.\\r\\nIn 2015, the Venice Biennale awarded Anatsui the Golden Lion for Lifetime Achievement. In 2017, Anatsui was awarded the Praemium Imperiale, the first Ghanaian to win this international art prize.\\r\\nOther awards include:\\r\\n\\r\\n1990 – Public Prize, 7th Annual Triennale der Kleinplastik\\r\\n1995 – Kansai Telecasting Prize, 6th Osaka Sculpture Triennial\\r\\n1998 – Bronze Prize, 9th Osaka Sculpture Triennial\\r\\n2008 – Visionaries!

Colina is one of the greatest exponents of Venezuelan monumental sculpture and framed much of his work within the cultural heritage of indigenous communities, with their sculptures celebrating the myths, legends, gods and chieftains of the tribes in Venezuela. He died in 1976 at the age of 75 years. His most famous work is the 1951 statue depicting the goddess Maria Lionza.\\r\\nAlejandro Colina\\'s parents were Alejandro Torcuato Colina, from Falcón State; and Fermina Viera, a Spanish lady originally from Santa Cruz de Tenerife.\\r\\nColina began his artistic development at the Academy of Fine Arts in Caracas at 13 years old. For seventeen years he worked as a mechanic for merchant ships, and as such, traveled for more than a decade. In 1919, he returned to Caracas and began to study at the School of Arts and Crafts in Caracas, where his works were exhibited and he became the Deputy Director of the institute.\\r\\nIn 1920, Colina decided to leave Caracas and moved to La Guajira, in Zulia State, where he coexisted with the indigenous peoples of the West of the country for eight years. During this time, he was devoted to taking notes and studying the ways, customs and legends of the local communities. Colina returned to Caracas, powerfully influenced by his long cohabitation with the indigenous peoples, who were to become the main themes for his work. Once back in the capital, Colina married Alejandrina Issa, who gave birth to his two sons.\\r\\nAt the end of the 1920s, Colina began to develop the Monument to the Liberator: the sculptural work to which he would devote much of his life. In 1931, Colina became the assistant to the Venezuelan architect, Alejandro Chataing.\\r\\nIn 1933, Colina created the sculpture Tacarigua Plaza, located in the Mariscal Sucre Air Base in the city of Maracay. Colina later faced accusation of being a Communist by the then president Juan Vicente Gómez, and was held at the Libertador Castle, Puerto Cabello, where in 1936 the poet Andrés Eloy Blanco was going to give a speech in occasion of the liberation of all political prisoners held by the Gómez dictatorship.\\r\\nAs the poet got aware of the presence of Alejandro Colina among the prisoners, he immediately took contact with his brother-in-law Pedro Sotillo, also  a poet, and asked him to talk with the Venezuelan President López Contreras in order to transfer Colina to a Health Center, being that the Psychiatric Hospital of Caracas, managed at that moment by Dr. González Rincones who offered Colina posterior to his treatment the use a room in the same Psychiatric Hospital, where he could continue develop his art to overcome his depression. In that same room he created the mural \"Arts, Science and Psychiatry\" and twelve busts portraying patients neighbors, each representing a particular disease.\\r\\nIn 1936 he married Emilia Heredia Hurtado, with whom he had three children. Colina continued to work, this time on the statue of the Cacique Guacamaya, located at the Military School in Caracas, and the presentation of the model of the Monument to the Liberator, which he worked on for over twenty-five years and which would be located in top of Cerro Avila, a mountain overlooking the valley of Caracas.\\r\\nIn 1951 he created the famous sculpture of Maria Lionza, a goddess originating in the indigenous state of Yaracuy, who appears in the statue as a beautiful Venezuelan woman riding a tapir. Colina portrayed her as naked and voluptuous, with wide hips and strong musculature, seated on the tapir which is standing on a snake. Maria Lionza offers, in arms outstretched toward the sky, a female pelvis, representing fertility.\\r\\nAlso created in the 1950s were the matte black statues and busts of Caciques Tiuna, Manaure, and Yaracuy.\\r\\nIn 1964 Colina finished the statue of San Juan de Los Morros, and in 1967 the famous statue of the chief Caricuao, which marks the entrance to the crowded residential area of the same name, West of Caracas.\\r\\nAt the time of his death, Colina left unfinished the sculpted torso of Cacique Chacao, intended for the Plaza del Indio in the Chacao municipality, also in Caracas.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee also\\r\\nPolitical prisoners in Venezuela\\r\\n\\r\\nReferences\\r\\nExternal links\\r\\nColina, Carlos (2002).

When he appeared on television, his fans would hold jars of water next to their televisions in the hope that the water would be able to cure disease.  At the height of his fame, he had a regular early morning television spot.\\r\\nChumak's performances typically followed a set formula.  First he would state the malady that the program was intended to address, for example allergies and respiratory disorders.  The disease would be explained as a disruption of the body's internal harmony.  The remainder of the program would consist of reiki-like hand movements.

He was the eighth Cambodian to win the Lillian Hellman/Hammett Award since 1995. He was one of only seven known adult survivors of S-21 camp, where 20,000 Cambodians were tortured and executed during the Khmer Rouge regime (Democratic Kampuchea).\\r\\n\\r\\nBiography\\r\\nVann Nath was born in Phum Sophy village, Srok Battambang district, Battambang Province in northwestern Cambodia. The exact date and year of his birth is unknown, but it was common for poor Cambodians born in rural areas not to have a proper birth certificate. He was educated at Wat Sopee pagoda as a child. His parents were separated, and he had two brothers and an older sister. They earned a living by selling a type of Khmer rice noodles called num banhchok. They were so poor that Nath had no chance to get a proper education. By the time he was 14 or 15, he was working at factory jobs for 500-600 riel a month (less than US$0.25).\\r\\nNath became interested in painting while he was studying at Wat Sopee pagoda. \"I became very attracted to painting when I went into the pagoda and I saw people painting a picture on the side of the wall of a temple.\" Instead of pursuing painting, he served as a monk from the age of 17 to 21. \"Every family has a son...one of the sons must go and serve as a monk — it is considered bad for the Cambodian family to not have a son who is a monk\", says Vann Nath.\\r\\nWhen his sister died, Vann Nath left the monkhood to start working to help support the family. He enrolled in a private painting school in 1965. \"School was far from my house, and I couldn\\'t afford a bicycle. Because our family life was hard, only my mother was working to support the whole family and she became older and older and I had to pay the tuition for the painting school.\" Later, the school allowed Vann Nath to work there in exchange for the tuition fee. After two years, he was able to profit from his own painting work.\\r\\n\\r\\nKhmer Rouge\\r\\nAt the time of his arrest on 7 January 1978, Vann Nath was working in a rice field in his home province of Battambang like many other Battambang locals. The Khmer Rouge took him to Wat Kandal, a Buddhist temple used as a detainment center. They told him that he was accused of violating the moral code of the organization of Angkar. He did not understand what that meant.\\r\\nA week later, he was transferred and deported to a security prison in Phnom Penh. This security prison is known as S-21 by the Khmer Rouge and it was formerly a high school known as Chao Ponhea Yat high school. There, people were interrogated, tortured and executed on a daily basis. After the Vietnamese invasion in 1979 and the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime, only seven adult prisoners made it out of the prison alive. Vann Nath was one of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nCareer\\r\\nVann Nath was a painter and writer whose memoirs and paintings of his experiences in the infamous Tuol Sleng prison are a powerful and poignant testimony to the crimes of the Khmer Rouge and the communist regime.\\r\\nVann Nath was an outspoken advocate for justice for victims of the crimes of the Khmer Rouge and this is reflected in his writing. His 1998 memoir A Cambodian Prison Portrait: One Year in the Khmer Rouge\\'s S-21 Prison, about his experiences at S-21, at that time was the only written account by a survivor of the prison. It has been translated from English into French and Swedish.\\r\\nVann Nath was one of Cambodia\\'s most prominent artists. His life was only spared by his captor, Comrade Duch, so that he could be put to work on painting and sculpting portraits of Pol Pot. He played an important role in helping to revive the arts in Cambodia after decades of war and genocide.\\r\\nDuring 2001 and 2002, Vann Nath worked intensively with Cambodian film director Rithy Panh in the preparation of a documentary film entitled S-21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine. Vann Nath was interviewed in the film, in which Panh brought together former prisoners and guards of the former Tuol Sleng prison. Vann Nath confronted and questioned his former torturers in the documentary film. To recognize their work, both Vann Nath and Rithy Panh have been conferred the title of Dr honoris causa by the University of Paris VIII on 24 May 2011.\\r\\n\\r\\nHonours\\r\\nHe was a recipient of Lillian Hellman/Hammett Award, which recognises courage in the face of political persecution, which he faced during the Khmer Rouge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIllness\\r\\nDespite battling long-standing health problems, including chronic kidney disease, Vann Nath continued to paint and write about his experiences under the Pol Pot regime. He suffered from a heart attack and went into a coma. He died on 5 September 2011 at the Calmette Hospital in Phnom Penh.

In the late 1970s, Debay served in the Rhodesian Armoured Car Regiment during the Rhodesian Bush War, 44 Parachute Brigade in the South African army during the South African Border War and later had a career as a journalist writing for Gazette des Armes. Debay was one of the founders of Raids in 1986 and worked for the French-language magazine for over 20 years covering military and war issues. In 2005, he founded his own military magazine called Assaut, for which he served as publisher, editor and journalist.

Builder of the Aqueduct of Matanzas, he was politically engaged, playing a significant role during the Ten Years' War in Cuba.\\r\\nMarried to Maria-Candelaria Martínez y Valdez, he was father of American Consul Alfredo Heydrich and Emilio Heydrich; he was also an ancestor of the artists Daniel Garbade and Juan Esnard Heydrich. He died in 1903, and was laid to rest at the Necropolis San Carlos Borromeo, Matanzas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAqueduct of Matanzas\\r\\nIn 1845, Manuel del Portillo successfully initiated the idea of an aqueduct for the supply of drinking water to Matanzas. Francis Albear y Lara, the engineer and chief, also encountered resistance. When Juan F. Sanchez and Bárcena also failed in a similar project, Fernando Heydrich proposed his own project together with G. Fabra and Cabanillas and his company, Heydrich & Cie, and received the order in 1870 to build a water channel from the springs of Manantial Bello y Benavides to Matanzas. They exploited the aqueduct til 1912. It still stands as a landmark of the city, and was chosen as a monument of the nation in 2005.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustry\\r\\nHeydrich was one of the first producers of Sisal on the island. With his son Alfredo and his company Heydrich and Raffoler & Cie, he requested the patent, which he finally got after a long dispute and thus began a new kind of production in Cuba.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitics\\r\\nDuring the insurrection of the rebels during the Ten Years' War, Fernando Heydrich played an essential role as founder and president of the Compania de Alemanes, also called the “Club Alemán”. Their task was the founding of a volunteer corps /militia to protect the goods of German and other foreign merchants. He received the explicit consent from Otto von Bismarck through a telegram to Consul Luis Will, in 1869, under the condition of preserving neutrality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References ==\", 'Nerses Ounanian (Armenian: Ներսէս Ունանեան) (1 August 1924 in Samos – 18 December 1957 in Montevideo) was a Uruguayan artist of Armenian descent.\\r\\nHe was a pupil of Antonio Pena and Edmundo Prati.

This was the setting for such pioneers as Javier de Aranburu, Miren Jone Azurza, Mikel Atxaga and the youngest of them all, Luis Aranberri.\\r\\nConcealed behind the pen name “Amatiño”, Luis Aranberri started off as the local correspondent for the weekly Zeruko Argia in 1964, and in 1972 he created the general news section ZENBAT GARA, which immediately became the main source of news for the then incipient Basque cultural renaissance.  Barely five years later, the historian and essayist Joseba Intxausti wrote:\\r\\n\\r\\nAmatiño (a pen name that has become household name in a very short period of time) is essentially a journalist. His work is linked to Zeruko Argia, the leading Basque weekly since [1963]. He has revealed an amazingly deft touch for a self-taught writer. He uses a direct, informative style of language and is not adverse to a hint of playful irony. In this field, he is arguably the country’s foremost writer.\\r\\nAmatiño’s popularity spilled over into the world of Spanish when in 1976 he joined the editorial board for the Culture section in the newly founded newspaper Deia and, yet more so, when he was put in charge of the News Services of ETB, Basque public television, which began broadcasting for the first time on January 1, 1983.\\r\\n\\r\\nExperience\\r\\nAs journalist\\r\\n1964–1976 – Reporter on Zeruko Argia.\\r\\n1977–1978 – Senior journalist in the Culture section of the daily newspaper Deia.\\r\\n1983–1984 – Head of the News Section for the Basque television network, ETB.\\r\\n1985–1986 – Director of ETB, Basque Television.\\r\\n1986–1988 – Editor of the weekly publication Eguna.\\r\\n1989–1990 – Assistant Editor of the daily Deia.\\r\\n1991–1995 – Director of ETB, Basque Television.\\r\\nDirector and presenter of seven television programmes.\\r\\nDaily or weekly columnist over 40 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nExperience in the civil service\\r\\n1979–1980 – Head of Cultural Promotions on the General Basque Council.\\r\\n1980–1982 – Director of Basque Language Promotions in the Basque Government.\\r\\n1995–1998 – Director of the Basque Parliament’s Presidential Affairs Section.\\r\\n1999-2002 – Director of the Departmental Office for Industry, Tourism and Trade.\\r\\n2004 – Director of Communication for EAJ-PNV, the Basque Nationalist Party’s internal executive: Euzkadi Buru Batzar.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrizes and awards\\r\\nKirikino award for Best Journalist in the Basque language.

The book discusses the unwanted sexual advances she received from Roger Ailes while working at Fox News, as well as her feud with then Presidential nominee Donald Trump.\\r\\n\\r\\nSummary\\r\\nKelly writes about her childhood and upbringing, her college years, her time spent as a practicing litigator, and her television career during her time at Fox News. The book is notable for its details Kelly shares about her relationships with Donald Trump and her former boss Roger Ailes.\\r\\nKelly explained the title for the book is a turn of phrase based on advice she received from Dr. Phil McGraw, \"He said the only difference between you and someone you envy is you settled for less. It just spoke to me.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nReception\\r\\nEntertainment Weekly\\'s Tina Jordan noted the book\\'s engrossing discussion of the author\\'s dealings with Roger Ailes and Donald Trump, but said the book offered more than just these intriguing events: \"The story of her years as an attorney and her subsequent rise in TV journalism is surprisingly moving, transforming Settle for More into a Lean In-ish primer for young women about the importance of hard work, self-esteem, and—most of all—perseverance.\" Lorraine Ali wrote in the Los Angeles Times, \"In prose that is simple, clean and straightforward, Kelly comes across in the book as casual and warm one minute, formal and stiff the next. It’s a duality that reflects her on-screen personality.\"\\r\\nThe day after the book\\'s release, the Los Angeles Times reported that Donald Trump supporters were leaving one-star reviews to hurt sales of the book.  HarperCollins noticed the high number of negative reviews, despite having only made a few advance copies available.  The detractors were reportedly mobilized through a pro-Trump Reddit forum called /r/The Donald. Amazon removed many but not all of the fake reviews, while reviews from verified purchasers were higher than those of unverified ones.\\r\\nSettle for More received mixed reviews from some media outlets, with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writing, \"the larger problem of Settle for More is that Ms. Kelly can’t quite decide what she wants it to be: A gossipy tell-all? An empowering self-help book? The basis for a Lifetime television movie? It’s this lack of cohesion that ultimately makes Settle for More a bit of a letdown.\" Slate wrote of the Settle for More, \"The book itself is often as wholesome as apple pie, and as unwise to consume in large servings.\" In another, generally positive review, The New Yorker conceded that Settle for More, \"is written with the political delicacy of a person still negotiating her next contract.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n== References =='], 'filenames': array(['./Biographies_Journalists\\\\Naivo_Journalists.txt',\n",
