When Mensah finished his apprenticeship, he worked for eight years with Paa Joe in Nungua as a master carpenter until he opened in 1998 his own studio called "Hello Design Coffin Works" in Teshie. Mensah participated in various art exhibitions in Europe and in some European film projects, like "Sépulture sur mesure" from Philippe Lespinasse.
