Raymond Petit (born 26 October 1954) is a Luxembourgian sculptor.
During his studies in the United States, Raymond Petit was initiated into the world of sculpture by following courses at the "William Howard Taft High School" in Los Angeles. He then embarked upon an artistic career with private and collective exhibitions that found a first recognition when he was granted the critics' prize at the VIIIth Biannual for Young Painters and Sculptors in Esch/Alzette in 1977.
Apart from working for exhibitions in Luxembourg, Oxford, London, Brussels, Rotterdam, Tokyo, Milan, Innsbruck, etc. Raymond Petit was also given commissions by the Luxembourg Government. Since May 1979 one of his sculptures highlights the entrance to the "Lycée Michel Lucius" in Luxembourg-City, and, ten years later, his monumental sculpture "Arch/Two People" is set up in the park of Useldange's Therapeutic Centre. Since 1993 one of his works enlivens the Town Hall of the parish of Hesperange and in 1995 he created a new cenotaph for the parish of Niederanven. Another monumental sculpture in front of the Integrated Centre for the Elderly in that same parish was inaugurated in 1998.
He is also the author of the book: "Everything you always wanted to know about European Unity but forgot to remember" European Unity
