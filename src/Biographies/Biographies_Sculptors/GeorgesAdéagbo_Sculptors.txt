Georges Adéagbo (born 1942) is a Beninese sculptor known for his work with found objects.
A native of Cotonou, Adéagbo studied law in Abidjan before moving to France to continue his studies in political science. He returned to Benin in 1971 upon the death of his father, and began creating installations and environments in isolation from family and society.  By the early 1990s, he had begun to receive recognition after being accidentally discovered by a French curator who stumbled upon Adeagbo's courtyard.  Eventually, years of work culminated in the reception of the Prize of Honor  at the Venice Biennale in 1999, for the "A Story of a Lion" installation project. Adéagbo gathers the material for his art wherever he travels. Today, he primarily resides in Hamburg, Germany and often work in his hometown of Cotonou.

"Create to Free Yourselves - President Lincoln's Cottage": A project centered around transforming and analyzing former President Abraham Lincoln's Washington, D.C., cottage to depict themes of freedom and bondage. The exhibit, taking place at the cottage where Lincoln lived during the Emancipation Proclamation, will re-work the world's image of the historical figure. Working alongside the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, this exhibit will be launched from January 17 to February 15. The exhibit will also have a major focus on intercultural transfer, with artists from Benin preparing the main objects and only assembly taking place at the D.C. Cottage. Adeagbo's artwork will provide a unique glimpse into the role of slavery and of the historical structure itself.
