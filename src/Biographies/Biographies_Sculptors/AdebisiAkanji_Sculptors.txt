Early life and education
In his early life he worked as a bricklayer, and first began to create sculptures as part of a competition to sculpt cement animals based on traditional architectural elements in Yoruba houses.

Career
Akanji is best known for his open-faced cement screens and other sculptural work. He has also worked in textiles. His work often illustrates themes from Yoruba folklore. In collaboration with Susanne Wenger, he worked for a decade on the Osun shrine in Osogbo, Nigeria, and is responsible for many of the shrine's sculptural elements.
