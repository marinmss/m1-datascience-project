Marcel Martí (1925–2010) was an Argentine-born sculptor of Catalan descent.

Life and work
At the age of three, he returned with his parents to Spain, where the family became  established in Barcelona. His father was imprisoned during the Spanish Civil War for activities related to his membership in Acció Catòlica. Martí began to draw by the age of 17, and became interested in sculpture in 1946. 
In 1948 he had his first exhibition in Barcelona. By 1953, he devoted himself almost entirely to sculpture. His works have been displayed at exhibitions and museums throughout the Americas, as well as in Spain.  
Following a figurative period, most of his work after 1958 tended to the abstract. Martí died at the age of 85 on August 11, 2010, in Catalonia.
