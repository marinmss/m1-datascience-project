Bedrós Hadjian (Armenian: Պետրոս Հաճեան; January 24, 1933 in Jarabulus, Syria – September 3, 2012 in Buenos Aires, Argentina) was a Buenos Aires–based Syrian Armenian writer, educator and journalist. In 1954 he became the headteacher of the Armenian school of Deir el Zor, in northern Syria, one of the destination points of Armenians marched off by Ottoman authorities during the 1915 Armenian genocide.
After teaching Armenian History and Literature at the Haygazian Armenian School of Aleppo from the mid-1960s, Hadjian was named in 1968 principal of the Karen Jeppe Gemaran, the biggest Armenian secondary school of Aleppo and one of the most prominent in the Armenian diaspora.
In 1970 Hadjian moved to Buenos Aires as the headmaster of the Instituto Educativo San Gregorio El Iluminador, one of the biggest Armenian schools in South America. He also became the editor of Armenia, an Armenian-language daily newspaper that became a weekly in the late 1980s, from 1971–1986. He retired as the headmaster of San Gregorio El Iluminador in 2003.
Since 1986, he devoted himself to writing fiction and non-fiction books, published in Buenos Aires, Aleppo and Yerevan.
He was a frequent contributor to Armenian newspapers such as Haratch in Paris, Nor Gyank in Los Angeles and Sardarabad in Buenos Aires on Armenian affairs, as well as literature and book reviews.
