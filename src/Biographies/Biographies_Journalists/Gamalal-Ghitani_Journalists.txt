He continued to write on the side and was imprisoned from October 1966 through March 1967 for his critical commentary on the regime of Gamal Abd el-Nasser. In 1969 he switched careers and became a journalist for the Egyptian newspaper Akhbar El Yom ("The Day's News").
After becoming a journalist, al-Ghitani continued to write historical fiction, and many of his stories are set in Cairo.
