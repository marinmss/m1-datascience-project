Mikhail Reva is a Ukrainian artist, sculptor, architect,  a founder of a non-profit organisation REVA Foundation.

Biography
Drawing inspiration from ancient folklores and philosophies, Mikhail Reva processes unfathomable symbolism by reconstructing it into physical sculptural form.  The tension between viewer and these imposing, anthropomorphized artworks sparks the imagination towards transcendent realms. The works of Michael Reva have a diverse nature and are presented in many places.
