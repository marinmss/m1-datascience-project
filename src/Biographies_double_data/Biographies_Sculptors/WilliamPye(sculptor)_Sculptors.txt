William Burns Pye (born 1938 in London) is a British sculptor known particularly for his water sculptures.

Biography
Pye is the son of Sir David Randall Pye FRS, a mechanical engineer and academic administrator. He attended the Dragon School in Oxford. He cites his aunt, sculptor Ethel Pye, as an early inspiration.
He undertook National Service between 1956 and 1958 then subsequently studied at Wimbledon School of Art (1958–61) and the Royal College of Art (1961–65). From 1965 to 1970 Pye taught at the Central School of Art before teaching at Goldsmiths, University of London for five years. In 1972 he was a visiting professor at California State University. He became known for his sculptures in metal, stone and especially water. In the 1960s, Pye's sculptures were abstract using metal and stone. In 1966 he had his first solo exhibition at the Redfern Gallery in London. Subsequent notable shows were held at Winchester in 1979 and Aberystwyth in 1980. In the 1970s, he produced abstract geometrical works using stainless steel, sometimes including kinetic aspects.
