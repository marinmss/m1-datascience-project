Géza Maróti (1875-1941) was a Hungarian architect, sculptor, painter, and applied artist.
Maróti was from a rural merchant family and began his career as a woodcarver but later went on to complete studies in Budapest and Vienna. He settled in Zebegeny before the outbreak of World War I and went on to complete numerous commissions both as an architect and a sculptor for public building projects. His  work, a cultural history of Atlantis, is still unpublished.
