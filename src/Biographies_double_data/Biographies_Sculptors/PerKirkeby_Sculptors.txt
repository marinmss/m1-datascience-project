Kirkeby taught as a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts, Karlsruhe beginning in 1978, the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (1978–1989) and at Städelschule in Frankfurt (1989–2000).
In 1996, he collaboratively works as a painter for three films with filmmaker Lars von Trier, creating the chapter headings for Breaking the Waves and Antichrist, as well as the visuals for the ouverture to Dancer in the Dark.
