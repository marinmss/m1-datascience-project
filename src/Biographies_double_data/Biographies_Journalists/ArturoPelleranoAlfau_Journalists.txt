Arturo Joaquín Pellerano Alfau (1864–1935) was a Dominican Republic merchant, publisher, and journalist. He, along with Julian Atiles, founded Listín Diario, the leading newspaper of the Dominican Republic, in 1889.  Pellerano tried to maintain the independence of his newspaper through many troubled times. During the US military intervention of 1916-24, he maintained a nationalistic line of constant protest. During Rafael Trujillo's reign, his newspaper office was attacked and he and his family were detained due to his decidedly Anti-Trujillo political views.
He married twice and had a total of 14 children. His family remained connected with the Diario until Banco Intercontinental bought it in 2003.
