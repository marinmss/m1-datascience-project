Carl Robert Jakobson (26 July [O.S. 14 July] 1841 – 19 March [O.S. 7 March] 1882) was an Estonian journalist, politician, writer and educator active in the Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire. He was one of the leaders of the Estonian national awakening in the second half of the 19th century.

Political activity
Between 1860 and 1880, the Governorate of Livonia was led by a moderate Baltic German nobility-dominated government. Jakobson became the leader of the radical Estonian nationalist wing, advocating widespread reforms. He wrote the first detailed socioeconomic and political programme for the Estonian national movement. Jakobson promoted the idea rural population as well as the urban Estonian-speaking commoners should fight for equal political rights with the region's Germans and for an end to the privileged position of local local landholding nobility.
In 1878, Jakobson established the Estonian newspaper Sakala. The paper quickly became a vital promoter of the cultural awakening. He also had a central role in the establishment of the Society of Estonian Literati, which was an influential Estonian association in the second half of the 19th century.
Jakobson died on 19 March 19 1882, at age 40, on his own farming estate, in the village of Kurgja (Pärnu county).
