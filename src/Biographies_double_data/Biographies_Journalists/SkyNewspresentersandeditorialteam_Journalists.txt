On 6 April 2016, Sky News announced that it was to launch a new show, The Pledge. It would not have a traditional presenter, but would instead have nine panellists, with five appearing on each episode. Michelle Dewberry, Nick Ferrari, Rachel Johnson, Graeme Le Saux and June Sarpong appeared in the first programme on Thursday 21 April.
