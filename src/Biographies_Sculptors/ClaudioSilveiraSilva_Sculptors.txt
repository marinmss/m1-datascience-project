Claudio Silveira Silva (1939–2007) was a Uruguayan artist, writer and sculptor.

Life
Silva had a Brazilian father and a Uruguayan mother. He spent his early life in Montevideo, where his family had moved after his birth. He studied painting and etching at the National School of Fine Arts, and earned a scholarship in Paris to the Ecole Supérieure des Beaux-Arts for exhibiting his printing abilities in the city. From 1974 until his death in 2007, he took up wood sculpting in a range of ductility. He taught drawing classes and ran a plastic sculpting workshop in Durazno, Uruguay.
