Calixte Dakpogan (born 1958) is a Beninese sculptor known for his installations as well as his masks made out of diverse and original found materials.  A native of Pahou, he currently lives and works in Porto Novo.  Much of his work is inspired by his Voudon heritage.
Dakpogan's work was exhibited at the "Ouidah '92" festival, which celebrated Vodun art from Benin and the African Diaspora in Ouidah, Benin in February 1993.
Many of his masks are part of The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi and are exhibited in major group shows in museums around the world.
