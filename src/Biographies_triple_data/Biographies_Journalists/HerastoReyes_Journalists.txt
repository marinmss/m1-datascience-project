Herasto Marcial Reyes Barahona (1952–2005) was a Panamanian journalist, writer and political activist. Reyes was born in Vallerriquito, Las Tablas, Los Santos on October 10, 1952.
He studied journalism at the University of Panama. In 1975 he took part in founding the Trotskyist Revolutionary Socialist League (LSR), which later became the Socialist Workers Party (PST). He contributed extensively to, and often edited, party organs like Revolución Socialista, La Verdad Socialista and Voz Independiente.
From 1980 to 1987 he was the director of the Centro de Comunicación Popular.
In 1987 he began working at La Prensa, where he would become Investigative Editor.
In 1992 he was awarded the UNICEF Press Award for his work for child rights.
The president of Panama, Ernesto Pérez Balladares, filed a libel suit against Reyes in August 1998, after Reyes had accused the administration of covering up a government embezzlement scandal. What followed was a lengthy legal process, which was highlighted by international human rights organizations.
