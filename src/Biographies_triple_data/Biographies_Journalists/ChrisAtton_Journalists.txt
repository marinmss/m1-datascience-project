Dr Christopher Frank Atton (born 10 March 1959) is the retired Professor of Media and Culture in the School of Arts and Creative Industries at Edinburgh Napier University.  His work focuses on Alternative Media where his contribution has concentrated on the notion of alternative media not as an essentialised political position but as a set of socio-cultural processes that redraw the boundaries of expert culture and media power. His research interests include popular music, the creative economy, infoshops, and teaching and learning in higher education.  Atton has also written on censorship and media ethics.

Education
Atton was awarded his PhD in 1999 with a study of the British alternative press; he also holds an MA (Hons) in Latin Studies from the University of Edinburgh and an MA in Mass Communications from the University of Leicester.

Academic career
Atton started academic life as a translator of Renaissance Latin texts before training as a librarian in Leeds in 1985.  After several years working in public and college libraries, he was appointed Science Librarian at Edinburgh Napier University in 1992.  He was made a Fellow of the Library Association (UK) in 1995 and received the American Library Association's Jackie Eubanks Memorial Award 'in recognition of outstanding achievements in promoting alternative media in libraries' in 1998. Following posts as Lecturer and Reader, Atton was conferred with Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy in 2007 and appointed Professor in the School of Arts and Creative Industries in October 2008.  He was appointed to membership of the Arts and Humanities Research Council's Peer Review College in 2010.
