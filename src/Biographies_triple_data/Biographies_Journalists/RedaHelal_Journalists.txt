Reda Helal (Arabic: رضا هلال) is an Egyptian journalist. He was deputy editor of Al-Ahram newspaper until 11 August 2003 when he disappeared in a presumed kidnapping. He was also a political activist, and a founding member of the Cairo Peace Society (CPS), a Copenhagen criteria support group.

Disappearance
Helal disappeared en route from Al-Ahram's offices to his home in Kasr El Aini hospital street in downtown Cairo. A factor which makes his disappearance all the more puzzling is that this is one of the most secure streets in the Egyptian capital as it contains the headquarters of the Arab League, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, the American Embassy and the Egyptian Museum.
On the day of his disappearance Helal's family presented a complaint about it to Sayyeda Zeinab police station. Human rights groups and activists, as well as a number of journalists, have pressured the Egyptian government over the incident.

Current development
In a response from the Interior Ministry to Talaat Sadat, The Ministry of Interior affirmed that no truth yet on the missing journalist case.
