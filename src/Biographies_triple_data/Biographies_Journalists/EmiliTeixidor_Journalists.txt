Emili Teixidor i Viladecàs (22 December 1932 – 19 June 2012) was a Catalan writer, journalist and pedagogue. He wrote over thirty novels, mainly for children and teenagers, but he is perhaps best known for his acclaimed adult novel, Black Bread (Catalan: Pa negre), which inspired a film of the same name.

Biography
Emili Teixidor was born on 22 December 1932 in the town of Roda de Ter in the Osona region of Catalonia. His mother, Filomena Viladecàs i Planas, was a worker in the local textile factory, and his father, Jaume Teixidó i Corominas, drove a bus. The family’s history was marked by the Spanish Civil War and the subsequent repression. Following the Francoist victory and the defeat of the Spanish Republic, Teixidor’s father was imprisoned by the fascists. Unlike so many other Catalans who opposed Franco, he was fortunate to be released from prison. An uncle, Josep Teixidor, rather than risk imprisonment or execution, fled to exile in Mexico.

Education
Emili Teixidor attended the local school, which had mixed age groups, and he began a lifelong friendship with Miquel Martí i Pol, who was four years older. However, unlike Martí i Pol, who had to leave school at the age of 12 in order to work in a textile factory, Teixidor was able to continue his education. After his father’s death in 1948, he was granted a scholarship and he moved to Barcelona, where he studied to be a teacher and then took a degree in law, to be followed by another in philosophy and literature, and finally one in journalism.

Teaching
After gaining his diploma in teaching training, he returned to the Osona as a teacher. However, in 1958 he cofounded the educationally progressive school, Patmos, in Barcelona. He was to be its head teacher until 1975.

Writing
Emili Teixidor began writing for young people in the late 1960’s in the belief that there was a need for novels which did not express the ideology of the Franco regime and the Catholic church and moreover were also written in Catalan. His historical novel The Firebird (Catalan: L’ocell de foc), published in 1972, was to become a popular classic. His first book for adults was a short story collection, Sic transit Glòria Swanson in 1979.

Journalism
Teixidor edited a French film magazine in Paris from 1976 to 1977. He then returned to the post-Franco Barcelona, where he worked as a newspaper columnist and television and radio scriptwriter.

Death
Teixidor died of cancer in Barcelona at the age of 78 in 2012.
