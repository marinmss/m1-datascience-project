She was an alumna of the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Arts (now the Emily Carr University of Art and Design) and was a member of the school's first graduating class.

Early life and career
Farley was born in Ottawa, Canada and moved to Vancouver with her family in 1924. She became a student at the Vancouver School of Decorative and Applied Art in 1925 and received her diploma in design in 1929. At the Vancouver School of Art, she studied design under James W. G. "Jock" Macdonald and drawing under Frederick Horsman Varley, as well as interacting with Charles Marega. In her third or fourth year, she received a scholarship in design. Farley also studied architectural sculpture at the University of British Columbia and completed post-graduate studies in theatre design and puppetry. In addition to Macdonald and Varley, Farley's work was influenced by stage and costume designer Harry Tauber, who studied extensively in Berlin and then Vienna under Josef Hoffman; Croatian sculptor and architect Ivan Meštrović, and Austrian puppeteer Richard Teschner, among others. She primarily worked in the media of wood, stone, and mosaic.
By the 1930s, Farley began to show her work at the Vancouver Art Gallery and from 1933-1935 she taught classes in design at the newly opened British Columbia College of Art. Farley was a founding member of the Federation of Canadian Artists in 1941. She also served as President of the Pasovas Arts Club in Vancouver, was an elected member of the Sculptors Society of Canada in the 1940s, and was elected a Life Fellow of the International Institute of Arts and Letters at Lindau, Lake of Constance in 1960. In 1948, Farley moved from British Columbia to Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, where she taught art at Whitehorse High School until 1972 and served as the first director for the Yukon of Canadian Crafts Council from 1973-74. She resided there until her death at the age of 83.
In Vancouver, Farley painted two murals, with accompanying bronze details, for the new Hotel Vancouver in 1939 and carved patterns for the Vancouver Post Office. In Whitehorse, she painted murals of the History of the Yukon for the Supreme Court Chambers in the Federal Building in 1955. In Ottawa, she completed colour plates for the Department of Indian Affairs (now Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada).
