Simone Ghini, also known as Simone Ghini I and as Simone I di Giovanni di Simone Ghini, was an Italian Renaissance sculptor from Florence who was born in 1406 or 1407.  He is best known for his funeral monument to Pope Martin V, in the Basilica of St. John Lateran, in Rome.  Together with Antonio Filarete, Simone also made a set of bronze doors for St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.  
Giorgio Vasari in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects erroneously stated that Simone was the brother of Donatello.  Simone Ghini died in 1491.
