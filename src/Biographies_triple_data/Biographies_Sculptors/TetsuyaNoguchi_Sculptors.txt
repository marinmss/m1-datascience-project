Tetsuya Noguchi (野口哲哉, Noguchi Tetsuya, born 1980 in Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture, Japan) is a Japanese artist known for his images of samurai in modern everyday or comical situations.

Biography
Noguchi was born in 1980 in Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture, Japan. He graduated from Hiroshima City University in 2003 specializing in oil painting, going on to complete graduate school there in 2005.
Since his youth, Noguchi has been inspired by science fiction, samurai films, history, and plastic models, and he uses these as influences in his paintings and sculptures. He was first inspired by a photo of a samurai taken around the end of the Tokugawa period, as well as by the works of Kobori Tomoto. His works have appeared in over 15 solo exhibits since his first in 2008. Two books featuring his works were published in 2014.
