Biography

After graduation van Munster settled as independent artist in Gorinchem. In 1967 he moved to Rotterdam, where he worked until 1985. From 1987 to 1991 he worked is Noordwelle, Schouwen-Duiveland, from 1989 to 2003 in Renesse, Schouwen-Duiveland, and afterwards in Vlissingen.

Van Munster died on 28 May 2024, at the age of 84.

Work
Van Munster’s work is minimalist in nature. He worked in wood, stone, bronze, glass, and other materials, and has also produced light sculptures and video art.  The focus of his work was on all forms of energy as a metaphor for life, with an emphasis on light and the energy with which it is loaded.
Tensions and oppositions, for example, between light and dark or heat and cold, are often illustrated in his work.
His notable projects include the Plus-Minus initiative, and the “IK” works. His works can be found in many cities in the Netherlands and Germany, in public spaces and museum and private collections. One of his works is part of the collection of the Centre for International Light Art (CILA) in Unna, Germany.

In popular culture
Van Munster's 1981 work Energie-Piek ijs was pictured on the inside cover of the 1988 Joy Division compilation CD Substance, while his light sculpture Plus et Min featured on the inner sleeve art of the reissued single Atmosphere released from the same album.  The latter in turn inspired the title and artwork of the band's compilation box set +- Singles 1978-80.
