Robert Fogell (born 1963) is a British sculptor, conservator-restorer, and art gallery owner.
Fogell trained in sculpture conservation under the artist Paul Giudici. His initial interest was in classical and modern stone sculpture. He has undertaken restoration work for public and private collections, including the British Museum, English Heritage, the National Trust, and the Victoria and Albert Museum.
He trained at the University of Warwick for a Cert Ed award and then taught at Northampton College, the University of Leicester, and Burghley House Education.
