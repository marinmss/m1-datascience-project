Theodor Friedl (13 February 1842 – 5 September 1900) was an Austrian sculptor.

Biography
Friedl was born on 13 February 1842 in Vienna, Austrian Empire. He studied at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna under Anton Dominik Fernkorn. Among his first major commissions was a program of architectural sculpture for the 1877 Vienna Stock Exchange, a collaboration with the Danish-Austrian Neoclassical architect Theophil Hansen. The program included a quadriga, six full-figure statues, and a series of frieze panels around the cornice line.
The same year Friedl had also begun a long-term working relationship with Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer for theaters across Europe, transmitting variations of the Viennese Neoclassical Ringstraße Style to Sofia, Brno, Berlin, etc.
Friedl died on 5 September 1900 in Warth, Austria-Hungary. He was buried with honors at the Zentralfriedhof Cemetery, with a portrait relief on his tomb by sculptor Leopold Kosig.
